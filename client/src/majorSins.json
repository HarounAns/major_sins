        "description": "a) To hold that Allah has an equal, whereas He has created you, and to worship another with Him, whether it be a stone, tree, sun, moon, prophet, sheikh, star, angel or other. This is the greatest shirk mentioned by\nAllah, the Most High, the Almighty, says,\n{Allah forgiveth not (the sin of) joining other gods with Him; but He forgiveth whom He pleaseth other sins than this; one who joins other gods with Allah hath strayed far, far away (from the right).} (An-Nisa :116)\n{False worship is indeed the highest wrong-doing.} (Luqman :13)\n{Whoever joins other gods with Allah; Allah will forbid him the Garden, and the Fire will be his abode.} (Al-Maidah :72)\nThe Qur'anic verses concerning this are very numerous. It is being absolutely certain that whoever ascribes associates to Allah and dies in such a state is one of Hell's inhabitants, just as whoever believes in Allah and dies as a believer is one of the inhabitants of Paradise, even if be should be punished first.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Shall I tell you of the worst major sins? Worshipping others with Allah, showing disrespect to parents, giving a false statement, and testifying to the truth of a falsehood. \" And he kept repeating it until we were telling ourselves (out of sympathy for him because of the strain of repeating it), \"If only he would be silent.” Reponed by Bukhari, Muslim and Tirmidhi.\n\"Avoid the seven heinous sins.”  and he mentioned ascribing associates to Allah. \"Kill whoever converted his religion (Islam).” Reponed by Bukhari, Ahmed, Ibn Hibban, An-Nasa'i and Abu Ya'la.\nb) Ostentation\nAllah, the Most High, says,\n{Whoever expects to meet his Lord, let him work righteous, and, in the worship of his Lord, admit no one as partner.} (Al-Kakf :110)\ni.e., does not show off in good works\n\"Beware of the lesser shirk.\" They asked, \"What is the lesser shirk?\" He said, \"Showing off in good works. Allah, the Almighty will say when recompensing the mankind for their deeds: Go to those whom you showed off to in the world to see how they could recompense you. .” Reported by Ahmad.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"If anybody associates something with Me, I am not affected. If anyone associates somebody with Me, in any way, I reject him and his act of associating.” Reported by Muslim. It's a Qudsi Hadith.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"A person who does some good work in order to boast will have his faults exposed by Allah Most High and a person whose motive in doing some good deed is to show it, Allah the Most High will treat him as a hypocrite.” Reported by A1-Bukhari.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"There may be a faster who does not gain from his fasting but hunger and thirst.”\nA wise man said, \"Just as the one who shows off in good works is the one who fills his purse with pebbles and leaves for the market to buy food. If he opened it before the seller he will be stoned with it in his face. He gains nothing but the people's inquiry about what fills his purse, nothing more. Thus, the one who shows off in good works will have no value but the people's saying that he did good and he will not be rewarded in the Hereafter.\"\nAllah, the Almighty, says,\n{And We shall turn to whatever deeds they did (in this life), and We shall make such deed as floating dust scattered about.} (Al-Furqan :23)\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"On the Day of Judgment some groups of people will be brought near Paradise. Having smelt its fragrance, and seen palaces and blessings therein, they will hear a call saying \"Take them away, it is not for them.\" Accordingly, they return so sorrowful that no one could have such feeling. They will call upon Allah, \"0 Lord were we entered into the Hell-Fire before seeing what You have prepared for Your Friends, it would have been better.\" Then Allah will say, \" That is what I want. When you were alone you defied Me with grievous sins, but when you meet people you showed off in good works, You only respected people not Me, You only refrain (from things) for their sake. Hence, today, I will severely torment you in addition to depriving you from My bountiful reward.” Mentioned by A1-Siuti in \"AI Laiali AI-Masnu'ah\" who related that Ibn Hibban said that it is false and has no reference.\nIt was related that a man asked the Messenger of Allah (pbuh)\n\"How can I be redeemed?\" The Prophet said, \"If you do not deceive Allah\" The man asked, \"How is Allah deceived?\" He replied, \"When you do something which Allah and His Messenger commanded you to do but you intended other than pleasing Allah. Beware of ostentation, it is the lesser shirk (polytheism); On the Day of Judgment, the ostentatious will be called at the presence of all creatures by four names: O Ostentatious, O traitors, O corrupt, O loser; what you did is wasted and your reward is nullified. We will not reward you, go and get your reward from whomever you acted to deceive?” Reported by AI-Zubaidi in lthaf\nA wise man was asked, \"Who is the sincere one?\" He replied, \"It is he who hides his good deeds as he does with his bad deeds.\" Someone asked, \"What is the good of sincerity?\" He said, \"When you dislike to be praised by people.\"\nAl-Fudail Ibn Eiad, may Allah be pleased with him said, \"To refrain from an action for the sake of people is ostentation. To do something for their sake is shirk (polytheism). But sincerity is to be aware of them.\nO Allah! Let us be away from them and forgive us."

        "description": "Allah, the Almighty, says,\n{If a man kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell, to abide therein (for ever); and the wrath and curse of Allah are upon him, and a dreadful chastisement is prepared for him.} (An-Nisa :93)\n{Those who invoke not, with Allah, any other god, nor slay such life as Allah has made sacred, except for just cause, nor commit fornication,' and any that does this (not only) meets punishment.} (Al-Furqan :68)\n{On that account: We ordained for the children of Israel that if anyone slew a person -unless it be for murder 'or for spreading mischief in the land -it would be as if he slew the whole people.} (Al-Maidah :32)\n{When the female (infant), buried alive, is questioned -for what crime she killed.} (At-Takwir :8-9)\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Avoid the seven heinous sins.\"\nAnd he mentioned taking one's life which Allah has made sacred except in the course of justice.\nIt was related that someone asked the Prophet (pbuh),\n\"What is the most heinous sin in the sight of Allah?\" The Prophet replied, \"To hold that Allah has an equal whereas He has created you.\" .The man asked, \"What else?\" The Prophet said, \"To kill your child lest he feeds with you.\" The man asked, \"What else?\" He said, \"To commit adultery with your neighbor's wife.” Reported by Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmidhi and An- Nasa'i.\nTherefore, Allah, the Almighty, revealed,\n{Those who invoke not, with Allah, any other god, nor slay such life as Allah has made sacred, except for just cause, nor commit fornication,. and any that does this (not only) meets punishment.} (Al-Furqan :68)\nIt was related that the Messenger of Allah said,\n\"When two Muslims meet with drawn sword, both the slayer and the slain are in the Hell.\" It was said, \"0 Messenger of Allah, that is for the slayer. But why the slain?\" He replied, \"Because his intention was to kill the other.” Reported by Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, An-Nisa'i, Ibn Majah and Ibn Hibban. Abu Suliman Al-Khitabi commented, \"Such punishment does not apply to a legal and justifiable combat. They entail this abode if they fight one another out of enmity, fanaticism, to acquire some worldly benefit or a position of leadership. Thus, out of this pole is the one who fights against an aggressive Muslim if he follows the rules of fighting and the one who defends himself without intending to kill the opponent.\n Whoever fights against an aggressive Muslim or a highway robber, should not seek to kill them. Rather he should try to deter him as much as he can. When they refrain we should refrain. The Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"You should not turn an unbeliever when I am no more (among you) and start killing and shedding blood among yourselves.” Reported by Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmidhi and An- Nasa'i.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"The first thing among human beings to be adjudicated on the Day of Judgment, will be the blood claim.” Reported by Bukhari and Muslim.\n\"Taking a believer's life is more grievous in Allah's sight than the perishing of this world.” Reported by Bukhari and Muslim.\n\"The major sins are worshipping others with Allah, showing disrespect to parents, killing a human being, and the breaking one's oath.” Reported by Bukhari and Muslim.\nIt is termed engulfing because it overwhelms its swearer in the Fire.\n\"For all the murders committed in this world without any justification, prophet Adam's son, Qabil will get a share of punishment, because it was he who inaugurated the method of killing by murdering his brother Habil.” Reported by Bukhari and Muslim.\nIf this is the abode of he who kills a covenant man then what about killing a Muslim?\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Whoever killed anyone of the people of the covenant will never get the aroma of paradise which can be smelt from forty years away.” Reported by Bukhari.\n\"Whoever helps in killing a Muslim even by just a part of a word, he will meet Allah with the written phrase on his forehead \"Despondent of Allah's Mercy.” Reported by Ibn Majah. It is a weak Hadith.\n\"Every sin might be forgiven by Allah except for a man dying an unbeliever or a man killing a believer deliberately.” Reported by Abu Dawud."

        "description": "Sorcery is a major sin because the sorcerer must necessarily disbelieve and the accursed Devil has no other motive for teaching a person witchcraft than that he might thereby ascribe associates to Allah.\nAllah, the Almighty, says,\n{Solomon did not disbelieve but Satan disbelieved, teaching men magic, and such things as came down at Babylon to the angels Harut and Marut. But neither of these taught anyone (such things) without saying, 'We are only for trial,' so do not blaspheme.' They learned from them the means to sow discord between man and wife. But they could not harm anyone except by Allah's permission. And they learned what harmed them, not what profited them. And they knew that the buyers of (magic) would have no share in the happiness of the Hereafter.} (Al-Baqarah :102)\nThus, you might find some people who are astray delving in learning sorcery and thinking that it is just unlawful. Actually, they do not consider what they do as disbelief, but it is! They embark on learning all kinds of sorcery: Pure sorcery, increasing or decreasing the love between a man and a woman, making a man important and the like. All of these practices are done by means of some unknown words, most of which lead to unbelief.\nThe penalty for a sorcerer is to be killed. This is because he is an unbeliever. The Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Avoid the seven heinous sins.”\nAnd he mentioned sorcery.\n\"The penalty for a sorcerer is the sword.” Reported by Tirmidhi.\nBijalah Ibn Abah related, 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) came to us one year before his death and said,\n\"Kill every sorcerer (male or female).” Reported by Abu Dawud.\nWahb Ibn Munabbih said, \"I read in a book: 'Allah the Almighty says, 'There is no god but Me. He is not of Me who practices sorcery, or asks someone to practice with him. The one who foretells or the foretold, the one who seeks an omen or for whom an omen is sought.” Reported by AI- Haythami in \"Majma' Az-Zawa'id to Al-Bazzar.\n`Ali Ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) said, A fortuneteller is a sorcerer, a sorcerer is a disbeliever.\"\nAbu Musa AI-Ashari, may Allah be pleased with him, related that the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n \"The drunkard, the one who severs the ties of kinship, and whoever believes in sorcery will not enter Paradise.” Reported by Ahmad.\nIbn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him) related that the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Incantations, amulets and spells are Shirk (polytheism).” Reported by Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah and Ahmad.\nThese are treated as Shirk because the ignorant believes that these things can affect what has been predetermined by Allah. However, AIKhattabi said, \"Incantations or healing words are permitted if they consist of the Qur'an or the Most Beautiful Names of Allah.\"\nThe Prophet (pbuh) used to recite (incantate) AI-Hasan and AlHusain by saying,\n\"I seek refuge for you in Allah's Perfect Words from every Devil, beast or envious .” Reported by Bukhari."

        "description": "Allah, the Most High, says,\n{But after them there followed a posterity who missed Prayers and followed after lusts soon, then, will they face destruction, except those who repent and believe, and work righteousness.}\n(Maryam: 59-60)\nCommenting on the above verses (Ayat), Ibn 'Abbas said,\n\"Allah's statement, \"Who missed Prayers does not mean that they did not perform it at all but rather they did not perform it in its due time.”\nSa'id Ibn AI-Mussaiyyib, Imam of the Tabi'een (may Allah be pleased with him) said, \"It is he who postpones the Dhuhr (Early Afternoon Prayer) until the time of Asr Prayer (Late Afternoon Prayer) and so are Maghrib (Sunset Prayer) until' /sha' (Evening Prayer), /sha until Fajr (Dawn Prayer) and Fajr until the sun rises. If someone dies persisting in such habits and does not repent to Allah, Allah promises to make him face Ghayy (destruction). But Ghayy may also be the name of a valley in the Hell whose bottom is so deep and tastes so bitter.\nAllah, the Most High, says,\n{So woe to the worshipers who are neglectful of their Prayer.} (Ma'un: 4-5) \nSa'd Ibn Abi Waqqas related, \"I asked the Prophet (pbuh) about the meaning of \"the worshipers who are neglectful of their Prayer.' He said, \"It is the delaying of performing the Prayer in its definite time.\" The word (Wayl) in the Ayah may refer to severe torture or it may be the name of a valley in the Hell. Were the whole mountains of the world brought in such valley it would melt because of severe heat. This is the abode of those who are not serious in Prayer unless they repent to Allah and regret for what they have done. Allah, the Almighty, says,\n{O ye who believe! Let not your riches or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah, if any act thus, surely they are the losers.}\n(AI-Munafiqun: 9)\nThe exegetes said, \"The remembrance of Allah in the above Ayah means the five daily Prayers.\nTherefore, whoever preoccupies himself with his property, trade, livelihood or children rather performing\nPrayer in its definite time will be a loser.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"The first of one's works that he shall be called to account for on the Day of Judgment is the Prayer. If he performed it well, he will be prosperous. Otherwise, he will be loser.” Reported by At- Tirmidhi who said it is authentic hadith but singular.\nAllah, the Most High, says,\n {What led you into Hell-Fire? They will say, 'We were not of those who prayed, nor were we of those who feed the indigent. But we used to talk vanities with vain talkers, and we used to deny the Day of Judgment until there came to us (the Hour) that is certain. Then will no intercession of any intercessor profit them.}\n(Al-Muddathir: 42-48)\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"The covenant between us and them consists of the Prayer:Whoever leaves it has disbelieved.” Reported by At- Tirmidhi.\nIt was related that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"Between a man and unbelief is the nonperformance of the Prayer.” Reported by Muslim.\n\"Whoever neglects the Prayer of 'Asr (Late Afternoon Prayer) will have his deeds vain.” Reported by AI-Bukhari.\n\"Whoever neglects the Prayer intentionally will be free from Allah's covenant.” Reported by Al-Haythami and Ahmed\n\"I have been commanded to fight people until they testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammed is the Messenger of Allah and perform the Prayer, and pay Zakah.

If he is preoccupied by wealth, he will be assembled with Qarun. If by kingdom, he will be with Pharaoh. If by ministry, he will be with Haman and if by trade, he will be with Ubai Ibn Khalaf.\" Mu'adh Ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) related that the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Whoever intentionally missed an obligatory Prayer there by becomes an unbeliever.” Reported before.\n'Umar Ibn Al-Khattab said, \"A man came to the Messenger of Allah and asked, \"O Messenger of Allah, what are most beloved deeds to Allah in Islam?\" The Messenger said, \"To perform Prayers on time, and whoever neglect Prayers has no religion. Prayers are the pillar of Islam..” Reported by AI-Baihaqi. It has a weak chain of transmission.\nWhen Umar was stabbed he was called to Prayer and replied by saying, \"Yes, whoever misses Prayer is non-Muslim.\" He then prayed while bleeding.\"\n'Abdullah Ibn Shaqiq, one of the Tabi'een, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Prophet's Companions did not view the nonperformance of anything as unbelief besides the Prayers.” Reported by At- Tirmidhi.\nWhen' Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) was asked about a woman who did not Prayers, he said,\n\"Whoever neglects Prayers is unbeliever.\"\nIbn Mas'ud also said,\n\"Whoever does not pray is an infidel.\"\nIbn 'Abbas stated, \"Whoever intentionally missed an obligatory Prayer entails Allah's wrath when he dies.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"Whoever dies neglecting the Prayers, Allah will not regard any of his good deeds.” It is cited by AI-GhazaIi.\nIbn Hazm said, \"The most heinous sins next to Shirk (polytheism) are the delayment of Prayers and taking a life of a believer except for just cause.\" Ibrahim An-Nakh'i also said, \"Whoever leaves the\nPrayers has disbelieved.\"\nMoreover, 'Aun Ibn 'Abdullah said, \"When a servant is laid in his grave, he will be asked, first about the Prayers. If it is accepted, his other works will be examined. If not, nothing will be examined any more.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"When a servant performed a Prayer on time, it will rise skyward enveloped with light until it reaches the Throne. There, it asks forgiveness to its doer up to the Day of Judgment, and says, \"May Allah preserve you as you have preserved me.\" But if the servant performs a Prayer out of its time, it will rise skyward enveloped with darkness. When it reaches the sky, it will be folded as an old cloth and then kicked back to the doer's face and says, \"May Allah make you lose as you missed me.” Reported by A1-Haithami and At- Tabarani.\n'Abdullah Ibn 'Amr Ibn AI-As related that the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Allah does not accept the Prayers of three people: whoever leads a group of people who dislike him,\nwhoever prays after missing the due time of the Prayer, and he who enslaved someone after freeing him.” Reported by Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah.\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"Whoever joins two Prayers together without a legal excuse, he then commits a major sin.” Reported by At-Tirmidhi and AI-Hakim.\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"When a boy reaches the age of seven years, teach him the Prayers (Salat), and punish him, when he commits a default (in his Prayers) at the age often years.” Reported by At- Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud\n It was related that the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"When your children attain the age of seven years, ask them to perform the Prayer and chastise them in respect of any fault in this behalf; when they are ten years old, let them sleep in separate beds.” Reported by Abu Dawud and Ahmad\nImlam Sulyman AI-Khattabi (may Allah be pleased with him) said, \"This hadith indicates that the punishment of nonperformance of the Prayer increases when the child reaches puberty. Some disciples of Imam Shafi'i cited the above hadith as an evidence to kill the child if he persisted to neglect the Prayer purposely 'after reaching puberty. They assumed that if he deserves to be struck while still a child thus he should rather face more severe punishment after reaching puberty and nothing can be lost severe than death.\nThere are differences among Islamic legal scholars as to the judgment of he who neglects the Prayer. Malik, Shafi'i and Ahmed all hold that the one who misses the Prayer is executed. Then they differ as regards his belief, should they call him an unbeliever or not (incase of neglectil1g the Prayer without a legal excuse)? The opinion that such a person become an unbeliever has been ascribed to Ibrahim AnNakh'iy, AYyub As-Sakhtiyani, 'Abdullah Ibn AI-Mubarak, Ahmed Ibn Hambal and Ishaq Ibn Rahawyah. Those who hold that whoever misses a Prayer becomes an unbeliever adduce the following evidence:\nThe ProPhet (pbuh) said,\n\"The covenant between us and them consists of the Prayer: whoever leaves it has disbelieved.” It is cited by AI-GhazaIi.\nThe Messenger also said,\n\"Between a man between unbelief is the nonperformance of the Prayer.” Reported by A1-Haithami and At- Tabarani.\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"Whoever keeps on performing the prescribed Prayer, Allah will grant him five honorable rewards: he will lead a happy life, avoid the torment in the grave, receive his record by his right hand, cross Sirat (the bridge on Fire) as swift as lightening and enter Paradise without being reckoned. But who is remiss in performing the Prayer, Allah will make him suffer fifteen kind of punishment, five in this world, three when dying, three in the grave, and three when being resurrected. The worldly punishments are: he loses the glamor (the blessing) of his life span, the righteous appearance diminishes from his face, he works in vain, he will not have his supplications answered and he will not make use of the righteous people's supplications.\nWhen dying: he dies humiliated, hungry, thirsty even if he drinks all the rivers of the world. In the grave: he will be compressed so tightly that his ribs permute, blazing in fire day and night and will face a baldheaded poisonous male serpent with two black spots over its eyes which are created of Fire and the fingernails of iron; each fingernail is equal to the distance covered in a day. It will address the deceased in a very roaring sound like thunder saying, \"I am the baldheaded poisonous male serpent, My Lord commanded me to beat you for missing the Fajr Prayer until sunrise, the Dhuhr until Asr, Asr Prayer until Maghrib, Maghrib Prayer until 'Isha' and Ish until Fajr.\"\nWhoever he strikes him, he sinks in the earth for seventy arms deep and he will keep sinking therein until the Day of Judgment.\nEventually, when being resurrected from his grave, he will be risen up with three lines written on his face:\n1) You neglect Allah's right \n2) You got Allah's wrath \n3) As you have neglected Allah's right in the world, you should despair His Mercy on this Day.” Reported by As-Siuti who said it is a forged hadith.\nIbn 'Abbas said, \"On the Day of Judgment, a man is brought before Allah. Then Allah issues a command to cast him into Fire. The man asks Allah, \"O My Lord, why? Allah, then, replies, \"Because you neglected to perform the Prayer in its time and you swear falsely by Me.\"\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"The first faces that will turn dark on the Day of Judgment are the faces of those who neglect the Prayer.\nIn the HellFire.. there is a valley called AI-Malham that contains serpents. Each serpent is as fat as a camel's neck and its length is equal to the distance covered in a day. Then, it stings the one who neglects the Prayer, the poison boils in his body for seventy years then the flesh is torn out.” Reported by AI-Hakim.\nOnce, an Israelite woman came to Musa (pbuh) and said, \"0 Messenger of Allah, I committed a grievous sin but I repented to Allah. So may you invoke Allah to forgive me and accept my repentance?\" Musa said, \"What was your sin?\" She replied, \"I committed adultery and then gave birth to a child whom I killed.\" Musa (pbuh) said, \"Go away corrupt woman lest the fire strike from the sky and bum us.\" Accordingly, the woman went out with a broken heart. Then, Jibreel (Gabreal) lauded and said, \"O Musa, Allah the Almighty asked you, why you rejected the penitent woman. Have not you found anyone worst than her?\" Musa asked, \"Who is that Jibreel?\" He replied, \"The one who intentionally neglects the Prayer.\"\nMas'ud AI-Badri related that the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"A Prayer is not valid if one's back is not upright after bowing and prostration.” Reported by Ahmad.\nThus, he who prays should remain motionless for a moment while bowing, prostrating, standing etc. It was related that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"The worst thief is he who steals from his Prayer.” Someone asked, \"How?\" He answered, \"When he does not bow, prostrate or recite therein perfectly.” Reported by AJ-Darami, Ahmed and AI-Hakim.\n\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Allah does not look to a man who does not rise his back upright and prostration.” Reported by Ahmed.\n\"This the Prayer of a hypocrite who watches the sun until he finds it about to set, then he stands and performs it as quick as a bird picking the seeds and he hardly remembers Allah in it.” Reported by Muslim.\nAbdullah AI-Ash'ari related, One day the Prophet (pbuh) led the companions in the Prayer. After finishing the Prayer, someone came in to pray. He started to pray so fast that he could hardly remain motionless for a moment while bowing or prostrating. Meanwhile, the Prophet (pbuh) said, \"Behold, if this man dies, he dies believing in a religion other than Muhammad's.\"\n'Umar Ibn AI-Khattab related that the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Whoever prays is surrounded by two angels on right and left. If he performed it properly, they take it and ascend to Allah, the Almighty. Otherwise, they struck his face with it.” Reported by Ad-Dar Qutni.\n'Ubadah Ibn As-Aumit related, the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Whoever makes ablution properly and performs properly the integrals of Prayer: bowing, prostration and recitation therein, the Prayer says, \"May Allah preserve you as you preserve me.” Then the Prayer is risen up skyward enveloped with light. When approaching the heaven 's gates, it will find it opened. So it keeps on rising up until it reaches Allah. There, it intercedes for the one who performed it. But if he does not perform (its integral) properly: bowing, prostration or recitation therein, the Prayer says, \"May Allah neglect you as you neglected me..” Then, the Prayer is risen up skyward enveloped with darkness.\nApproaching the gates of heaven, it will find it closed. Then, it will be folded as an old cloth and kicked back to the doer's face.” Reported by Al-Haithami.\nSalman AI-Farisi narrated that the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n“The Prayer is a measure. Whoever gives a just measure, he will be rewarded in full. Whoever stints, you know what Allah says about the stinters. \"\nAllah, the Almighty says,\n{Woe to the stinters.} (AI-Mutafifeen: l)\nThe stinter is he who stints when weighing or measuring out goods or Prayers. Allah promises to punish them with Wail. A valley in the Hell-Fire from its heat the Hell itself seeks refuge. We seek Allah's refuge from it.\nIbn ' Abbas narrated that the Prophet (pbuh) said, . \"Whoever prostrates should place his forehead, nose and hands on the floor, as Allah has revealed upon me to prostrate on five organs: Forehead, nose, the palms of hands, the knees and feet. I have also not to prostrate on hair nor cloths. Thus, .whoever prostrates improperly, the organ that fails to touch the floor will curse him until he completes the Prayer.” Reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim.\nAI-Bukhari reported on the authority of Huzayfa Ibn AI- Yamman (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that he once noticed a man praying but he bowed and prostrated improperly. He said to hi,: \"You did not pray. If you die, you will die believing in a religion other than Muhammad's (pbuh).” Reported by A1-Bukhali.\nIn Abu Dawud's narration, the above hadith is reported as following, \"How long have you prayed in this manner?\" He said, \"Forty years ago;\" He said, \"You did not pray forty years ago and if you died you would die believing in a religion other than Muhammed's (pbuh).\"\nAI-Hassan AI-Basri used to say, \"O son of Adam what is dearer to you of your religion than Prayers. It is the first thing that you will be called to account for on the Day of Judgment. The Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"The first of people works that they should be called to account for on the Day of Judgment is the Prayer. Our Lord, Holly and Exalted will say to His angels, while knowing better than they, \"Look at the Prayer of My servant. Did he perform it in full, or fall short of it?\" If it is in order, then he will have prospered ad succeeded; if it is wanting, then he will have failed and lost. While if anything is missing from it, He will say, \"Look to see if My servant has any supererogatory worship.” And if he has, Allah will say, \"Complete My servant's obligatory Prayers for him from his supererogatory ones. “And he will be dealt with likewise in his other works.” Reported by Ad-Dar Qutni\nHence, we should increase our supererogatory worshipping to complete the obligatory ones if they fall shorter.\nThe punishment of he who misses the congregational Prayer though he is able to do, Allah, the Almighty Says,\n{The Day that the shin shall be laid bare, and they shall be summoned to prostrate, but they shall not be able, their eyes will be cast down, ignominy will cover them; seeing that they had been summoned aforetime to bow in adoration, while they were whole, (and had refused.)}\n(AI-Qalam: 42-43)\nSa'id Ibn AI-Musaiyyib commented, although they were whole in this world, they did not answer the caller to Prayer. On the other hand, Ka'b AI-Ahbar said, By Allah, this Ayah is only revealed concerning those who missed the congregational Prayer. 0' what a severe torture awaiting for those who are able to perform the Prayer in congregation, but they do not.\"\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"I have considered having a man lead people at Prayer and going myself to those who hang back from attending the Prayer in congregation to burn their houses down upon them.” Reported by Bukhari and Muslim.\nBehold, this threat cannot be issued unless there is something obligatory left.\nIt was related that once, a blind man came to the Prophet (pbuh) and said,\n\"0 Messenger of Allah, I have nobody to lead me to the mosque.\" Then he asked for a permission to pray at home. Thereby, the Prophet permitted him. But before leaving, the Prophet called him and said, \"Do you hear the Call to Prayer?” He said, yes. The Prophet said, \"Then you have to respond to it.” Reported by Bukhari and Muslim.\nOnce, 'Amr Ibn Umm Maktum came to the Prophet (pbuh) and said,\n\"0 Messenger of Allah, in Madina there are numerous number of reptiles and beasts whereas I am a blind man and live far away from the mosque. Further, I have an inconvenient guide. Shall I have a dispension to pray at home? \"Then, the Prophet (pbuh) asked, \"Do you hear the words of the Call to Prayer?\" He said, yes. The Prophet said, \"Then, you have to respond to it, I have no dispension to you.” Reported by Muslim.\nBehold, that is a blind man and faces many hardship in his way to the mosque and has no guide, yet the Prophet does not permit him to pray at home. How about the sightful people who have no excuse?\nTherefore, when Ibn 'Abbas is asked about someone who fasts the day and prays the night but does not attend the Friday or congregational Prayer. He replied, \"If he dies doing that he will enter the Hell-Fire.” Reported by At- Tirmidhi.\nAbu Hurayrah said, \"It is better for one's ears to be filled with molten lead than to hear the Call to Prayer without answering it.\"\nIbn 'Abbas related that the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Whoever heard the caller to Prayer and did not answer not because of an excuse.” Someone asked,\n\"What kind of excuse is that, Messenger?\" He said, \"Fear or sickness, he will not have his Prayer accepted.” Reported by Abu Dawud, AI-Hakim and Ibn Hibban.\ni.e., the Prayer which he performed at home.\nIbn ' Abbas also related that the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"There are three people whom Allah cursed: Whoever leads a group of people in Prayer who dislike him, a woman whose husband spends the night angry with her and whoever heard the call to Prayer but he does not answer.” Reported by At- Tirmidhi.\n'Ali Ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) said, \"A Prayer of a neighbor of a mosque is only accepted in the mosque.\" Someone asked, \"Who is a neighbor of a mosque?\" He said, \"Whoever hears the call to Prayer.\"\n`Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud related that the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"A person who likes to meet Allah tomorrow (on the Day of Judgment) as a true Muslim, he should then take care of those Prayers where (and when) he is summoned for them. This is necessary as Allah has laid down some practices and rules for us to follow (which have reached us) through our Prophet (pbuh) and these Prayers are among them. If you offer Prayers at your houses as this good for nothing person is doing, you will be guilty of neglecting the way of your Prophet (pbuh) then you go astray. I have seen the people in condition when only known hypocrites used to be out of the lines of congregation. Some of us used to be brought to the mosque with the help of two men on account of their weakness or illness, until they could stand in line.” Reported by Muslim.\nAr-Rabie Ibn Khutham had a disease in his leg. He used to go out for Prayer leaning on two men. They advised him, \"O father of Muhammed, Allah has permitted you to pray at home as you have a legal excuse.\" He said, \"Ok, but I hear the call to Prayer. Whoever could answer even if he creeps or crawl, it is better to do so.\"\nHatim AI-Asam said, \"One day, I missed a Prayer in congregation but no one lead me except Abu Ishaq AI-Bukhari. However, if one of my children died, there would be ten thousand people who offer me condolence. This is because a trial in religion is easier than a one at the sight of people.\nSomeone of early Muslims said, a congregational Prayer is missed because of sins. Ibn 'Umar narrated,\n\"Once Umar was in his garden, when coming back, he found that the people had performed the Asr Prayer.\nThereby, he said, \"We will surely return to Allah! I missed the Asr Prayer in congregation. May you witness that I gave my garden in charity to the needy so as to expiate what 'Umar had done.\"\nIt is recommended to pay more attention to 'Isha' and Fajr. The Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"The hypocrites find dawn (Fajr) and night (Isha') Prayers in congregation as very oppressive. If they could know the virtues of these two Prayers, they would certainly join them, even if they had to go crawling.” Reported by AI-Bukhari.\nIbn 'Umar said, \"When missing a man in the congregational Prayer of Isha and Fajr, we might think that he was a hypocrite.\"\n'Ubaydallah Ibn Amr Al-Qawarir said, \"I have never missed Isha Prayer in congregation. One night I had a grief which occupied me from performing the' Isha' Prayer in congregation. Thereby, I sought for another mosque allover AI-Basra to realize the Prayer but of no avail all the mosques were closed. Then I went home and decided to apply what is stated in the hadith,\n\"Recompense for Prayer offered along with the congregation is twenty seven times more than the Prayer offered in home or.” Reported by Muslim.\nTherefore, I performed' Isha' Prayer twenty seven times. Afterwards, I slept. I dreamt that I was riding my horse racing some other people who were also riding their horses but I could not catch them. Then one turned to me and said, \"Do not get your horse toiled, you would never catch us. I asked him why? He said,\nwe performed the 'Isha' Prayer in congregation but you did alone. Then I got up so sad.\nWe seek Allah's help and guidance for He is the Most Generous, the Most Bounteous."

Zakat is also obligatory for trade.\nAbu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, related that the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Whoever is made wealthy by Allah and does not pay the Zakat of his wealth will be made like a baldheaded poisonous male snake with two black spots over its eyes. The snake will encircle his neck and bite his cheeks and say, \"I am your treasure \" Then he recited the following verse, {And definitely let not the ones who are miserly with what Allah has given them,' no indeed, it is an evil (thing) for them.

When we entered his house and sat down for a while, he said,\n“Let us visit a neighbour whose brother has recently died to console him.” Then, we all went to the man but we found him wailing and impatient for the death of his brother. Accordingly, we tried to console him but of no avail. We admonished him that death is an inevitable end. Then, he said, I know. I just weep for my brother’s death abode and the torture he is in. We asked, “Did Allah enable you to know the Unseen?” He said,” Of course not, but when I buried him and people went away I sat down by his grave. Meanwhile, I heard a sound of distress. I heard someone crying.” Oh, they left me alone to suffer the torture. I was praying, and fasting. Then, I wept and out of pity I began to snatch the grave to see him. The grave was full of fire and I noticed a circle of fire around his neck. Out of pity I extended my arm to extricate him from such circle of fire. No sooner did I extend my hand than my fingers were burnt. Then, the man showed us his burnt hand. He went on saying, I hoarded the earth over him again and went away. Thus, how can I keep patient after I have seen how he is.

He was so devout that he exerted great efforts in performing many prayers, fasting and spending money in charity. He had a fatal disease that his wife informed the Prophet (pbuh) that her husband was dying. Thereby, the Prophet (pbuh) sent `Ammar, Suhaib and Bilal to instruct the dying to say the testification of Faith. When they arrived there, they found him dying. Therefore, they began to instruct him to say there is no god but Allah, but he could not repeat it.\nThey returned to the Prophet (pbuh) to consult him. Then, the Prophet (pbuh) said, \"Did he have living parents?\" They said, \"He had an aged mother.\" Accordingly, the Prophet asked them to bring her if she was able to walk. Otherwise he himself will go there. When being informed by the Prophet's message, the mother said, \"I sacrifice him with my soul. I will go to him.\" She then went to him leaning on a staff. After greeting, the Prophet (pbuh) said; \"O mother of Alqamah, tell me the truth and if you lie Allah will reveal me the truth. How was Alqamah?\" She said, \"He performed much prayers, fasting and spending money in charity.\" Then, the Prophet (pbuh) asked, \"What about you?\" She said, \"O Messenger of Allah! I am angry with him.\" The Prophet asked, \"Why?\" She said, \"Because he prefers his wife to me and also disobeys me.\"\nThen, the Prophet (pbuh) said, \"The anger of Alqamah's other holds Alqamah's tongue to utter the testification of Faith.\"\nAfterwards, the Prophet said, O Bilal, go and gather a pile of wood.\" The woman said, \"Why, Messenger of Allah?\" The Prophet said, “To bum him before your eyes.\" She said, \"O Messenger of Allah, he is my son! I cannot endure that he be burnt before my eyes.\" Then, the Prophet said, \"But Allah's torture is more severe and lasting, mother of `Alqamah. So if you like him to be forgiven by Allah, you forgive him. By Whom in Whose hands my soul is, what he performed of prayers, fasting and charity is of no avail so long as you are angry with him.\"\nThen, she said, \"O Messenger of Allah, may Allah the Almighty, his angels and all Muslims who are present witness that I forgive my son, Alqamah.\" Thereupon, the Prophet said, \"Go to him, Bilal to see whether he can utter the testification of Faith or not? She might forgive him out of shyness.\" Approaching Alqamah's house, Bilal heard him saying, \"There is no god but Allah\" Then, the Prophet (pbuh) ordered them to prepare the funeral, washing and shroud. Then, he prayed over him and witnessed the funeral.\nThen, the Prophet stood in front of the deceased grave and said, \"O Muhajirin (Emigrants) O Ansar\n(Helpers), he who prefers his wife to his mother entails the curse of Allah, His angels and the whole people. Allah never accepts his deeds or a reason unless he makes repentance, treats his mother well and asks her consent. This is because Allah's consent is conditioned on the mother's and His wrath is hers.” Reported by Ibn Hajar AI-Haithami."

Thus, you have to go to Yemen where there is a well-called Barhut. It is said that this well is at the mouth of the Hell, and call upon the man at midnight. Therein, if he is among the people of Fire he will answer you- Having arrived in Yemen and approaching the well, he called upon the man and the man responded. He asked him about the wealth. He told him that he had buried it in such and such a place. Thus, you could go there and dig to regain your wealth. Then, he asked him why he was in such a (horrible) place though we thought good of you?\" He said, \"I had a poor sister whom I abandoned and did not treat her well. Thereby, Allah punished me because of her.\"\nThis is shown in the Hadith : \n\"He who severs the ties of his family will not enter Paradise.”\nAs above Reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim."

        "description": "Allah, the Almighty, says,\n{Nor come nigh to adultery: for it is an indecent (deed) and an evil way.} (Al-Isra': 32) The Qur'an also states,\n{Those who invoke not, with Allah, any other god, Nor slay such life as Allah has made sacred, except for just cause, nor commit fornication,' -and any that does this (not only) meets punishment. (But) the chastisement on the Day of Judgment will be doubled to him, and he will dwell therein in ignominy.}\n(Al-Furqan: 68-70)\nAllah, the Most High, says,\n{The woman and the man guilty of fornication, flog each of them with a hundred stripes: Let not compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day:\nAnd let a party of the believers witness their punishment.” (An-Nur: 2)\nThe punishment mentioned in the last verse concerns only single fornicators in the world as argued by the scholars. In case of married adulterers (even if they experienced marriage before) they must be stoned until death as postulated by the Prophet (pbuh). But if they escaped the worldly punishment and died without making repentance, they will be tortured in the Hell-Fire with lashes of Fire.\nIn Psalms, it is narrated that Adulterers will be hanged from their genitals in the hell-Fire, on which they will be scourged with slashes of iron. If they cry out of pain, the angels of punishment will address them,\n\"Where was this cry inaudible before? You just used to laugh, play and did not keep the thought of Allah, nor were you shy from Him.\"\nThe following hadith was stated by the Prophet (pbuh),\n\"An adulterer is not a believer at the time of committing adultery.” Reported by AI-Bukhari and Muslim.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"When someone fell in adultery, faith leaves his heart and overshadows him but if he extricates himself; his faith will, be restored again.” Reported by Abu-Dawud.\nIt was related that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"Whoever fornicates or drinks wine, Allah takes off his faith from him as a man takes a shirt off over his head.” Reported by AI-Hakim.\n\"There are three people to whom Allah, the Most High will not talk, nor will He absolve them of sins nor look at them: an aged person guilty of adultery, a king who lies and a poor beggar who is proud.” Reported by Muslim.\nOn the authority of Ibn Mas'ud who said, \"I asked the Messenger of Allah (pbuh),\n\"What is the most grievous sin at the sight of Allah?\" He said, \"To associate others with Allah whereas He created you... and to commit adultery with your\nneighbour's wife.” Allah, the Almighty, said,\n{Those who invoke not, with Allah, any other god, nor slay such life as Allah has made sacred, except for just cause, nor commit fornication; -and any that does this (not only) meets punishment. (But) the chastisement on the Day of Judgment will be doubled to him, and he will dwell therein in ignomity.} (AL-Furqan: 68-69)\nBehold! How adultery with one's neighbor, polytheism and slaying the life of others except for just cause are associated with each other.\nOnce, Ibn Mas'ud asked the Prophet (P.B.U.H) saying, \"0 Messenger of Allah, what is the most heinous sin? The Prophet answered, \"To hold that Allah has an equal, whereas He has created you. Further he asked what is next? The Prophet (P.B.U.H) said, \"To kill child lest he feeds with you. He added, \"What is next? The Prophet (P.B. U .H) said, \"To commit adultery with your neighbor's wife.” Reported before.\nWhen commenting on Allah's statement,\n{To it are seven gates: for each of those gates is a special) class (of sinners) assigne.} (Al-Hijr: 44)\nAta' said, \"The most grievous and hated gate of Hell is that which is assigned for adulterers who committed such crime after they had been informed of its consequences.\nMakhul Ad-Dimashqi said, \"When the people of the Hell-Fire smell a stinking odor they say, 'We have never smelt an odor more stinking than that, Then, they will be told that this is the odor of the adulterers' genitals. Ibn Zayd, one of great exegesists said, \"This odor hurts all the people of the Hell-Fire. Of all commandments prescribed by Allah to Moses is the following,\n\"Do not steal and do not fill into adultery so as not to screen My Face from you.\"\nBehold Moses is the addressee, what about the others.\nIt was reported that the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Satan (Iblis) often sends his soldiers every where in the earth saying to them, 'Whoever diverts a Muslim I will crown him. The most skillful one in diverting people, the nearest to me. Meanwhile, a devil comes and says, \"I kept tempting such and such until he divorced his wife.' Iblis says, 'You did nothing. He will marry another woman.' Another comes and says, 'I kept tempting such and such until I created a grudge between him and his brother’ Iblis says, 'You did nothing. He will reconcile with him.’ Eventually comes another devil who says, 'I kept tempting such and such until he fell in adultery.’ Iblis says, 'Great and well done. I\nThen he makes him nearer to him and crowns him.” Reported by Al-Siuti\nWe seek Allah's refuge from the evils of Satan and his soldiers.\nIt was reported that on the authority of Anas that the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Faith is like a garment with which Allah covers whomever He likes. But if he falls in adultery, this garment will be taken off and if he repents He will restore it again.” Reported by Ad-Dai1ami. It's a weak hadith.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) also said,\n\"0 Muslims, be aware of adultery. It entails six consequences: Three in this world and the others in the next. As for the worldly consequences, they are a pale face, short life and long poverty. The consequences in the Hereafter are: The wrath of Allah, a severe reckoning and torture in Fire.” Reported by A1-Siuti.\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"Whoever persists in drinking wine and then dies, Allah will make him drink from the river of Ghuta, a river flows the genitals of the whores.” Reported by Ahmad. \nIn the Fire there will be pus flowing from the whores' genitals that which will be offered to whoever dies persisting in drinking wine.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Next to polytheism (shirk), is the semen ejaculated by a man in an unlawful womb.” Reported by Ibn A1-Jawzi.\n\"In the Hell-Fire there is a valley in which contains serpents. Each serpent is as fat as a camel's neck. When it stings the one who does not pray, it's poison boils in his abode for seventy years and then his flesh is torn out. There is also a valley called the well of Hazan (suffering) which contains serpents and scorpions. Each scorpion is as huge as a mule and has seventy spines. Each spine ends in a poisonous edge. Then, it strikes the adulterer and sprays poison in his body. The adulterer suffers from this painful poison for a thousand years. Then his flesh is torn out and pus flows from his genitals.”\n\"Whoever makes love with a married woman, they will suffer the torture which is supposed to afflict half of this nation in grave. Afterwards, on the Day of Judgment, Allah will give her husband, who does not know (what she does), the right to dispose her good deeds. But if he knows and does nothing, he and his wife will be deprived of Paradise as there is a statement on the door of Paradise which reads, unlawful for the pimp.”\n\"Whoever touches a woman, who is not lawful to him, because of lust, he will be resurrected with his hand tied to his neck on the Day of Judgment. In case of kissing, his lips will be nipped in the fire. Eventually, if he fell in adultery, his thighs will witness against him, on the Day of Judgment by saying, \"I lied on an unlawful\" Then, Allah looks to him out of wrath. Thus, his face's flesh fells down. If he arrogantly says, \"I never did so\" Then the tongue witnesses by saying, 'I produced an unlawful utterance.' The hand also says, 'I touched unlawful things.' The eyes says' I looked to the unlawful.' The legs say:' To the unlawful objects did I walk' Finally, the genital says, 'I applied. ' As for the guardian angels, he says, 'I heard, and another says,'I wrote' eventually, Allah says, \"I knew but concealed him.”\nThen, Allah says,\n\"0 angels! Take him away to torture him. Severe is My wrath on those who are not shy from Me.\" This is shown in Allah's Book Exalted be He:\n{On the Day when their tongue, their hands, and their feet will bear witness against them as to their actions.} (AINur: 24).”\nThe most grievous kind of adultery is incenstry with one's mother, sister, stepmother and unmarriageable relatives.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Whoever falls into adultery with an unmarriageable relative, must be killed.” Reported by AI-Hakim.\nAI-Barra' narrated that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) sent his uncle to a man who made love with his step mother to kill him and divide his wealth into five parts (like the spoils of war.)\nTherefore, we ask Allah the Bounteous to forgive our sins for He is the Most Bounteous, the Most Kind."

        "description": "Allah, Most High recounts in His Book the story of Lut's people in several positions. Allah, the Almighty says,\n{When Our decree issued, We turned (the cities) upside down, and rained down on them brimstones hard as baked clay, spread, layer on layer, marked from thy Lord; nor are they ever far from those who do wrong!\"}\n(Hud: 82-83)\nThis abode is not far from those who do wrong amongst our nation if they committed the same sin.\nTherefore, the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"What I fear most is that my nation may follow the crime of Lut's people.” Reported by At- Tirmidhi.\nThe Prophet also said,\n\"May Allah curse him who does what Lut's people did.” Reported by At- Tirmidhi.\nHe said it twice.\nIt was related that the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Whoever is caught doing the crime of Lut's people, you should kill the one who sodomizes and the one who lets it be done to him.” Reported by At- Tirmidhi.\nIbn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with hi) said, \"Look for the highest building in the town, and then throw them down and stone them like the abode of Lut's people.\"\nThere is a scholarly consensus that sodomy is among the major sins forbidden by Allah,\n{Of all creatures in the world, will ye approach males, and leave those whom Allah has created for you to be your mates? Nay, ye are a people transgressing (all limits!}\nA-Shu`ara: 165-166)\nAllah, Most High, says,\n{And Lut, too, We gave Judgment and Knowledge, and We saved him from the town which practiced abominations: truly they were a people given to evil, a rebellious people.}\n(Al-Anbya': 74)\nThe town where those people lived was called Sodom. They used to practice the abominations mentioned by Allah in His Book. They used to commit sodomy; make sounded wind in their assembly and many other offensive practices.\nHe (pbuh) said,\n\"Lesbianism is adultery between them.\"\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Four people entail Allah's wrath in night and day. \" It was asked, \"Who are they, Messenger of Allah?\"\nHe answered, \"Effeminate men and masculine women, the adulterer of animals and sodomizers.” Reported by Ibn Hajar Al-Haithami on the authority of Abu Hurairah in Majma Al-Zawa`id.\nIt is narrated that when two men start to commit sodomy, Allah's Throne vibrates fearing Allah's wrath.\nThe heavens almost fall on the earth but the angels hold their outskirts and recite Surat AI-Ikhlas until Allah's wrath reposes.\"\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"On the Day of Judgment, there will be seven people who will be excluded from\nAllah's Mercy and purification. Allah will sentence them to enter the Hell-Fire\nwith those who enter it: Those who commit sodomy, the one who commits\nmasturbation, the one who approaches an animal from its anus, the one who\napproaches a woman from her anus, the one who marries a woman and her daughter\naltogether, the adulterer of his neighbor's wife and the one who brings harm to\nhis neighbor until he accurse him.” Reported by Ibn Kathir in his ‘Great\nExegesis”. It is Gharib hadith.\nIt was narrated that, \"there will be some people who will be assembled on the Day of Judgment with pregnant hands because of committing adultery. They used to make play of their genitals in the world.\"\nIt was also narrated that,\n\"Among the practices of Lut's people is playing with dice, competing by flying pigeons, entering the bathroom naked, cheating in measures and weights. O woe to those who do so.” It is subsumed under weak hadiths.\nIbn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said, \"When a sodomite dies without making repentance, he will turn into a pig in his grave.\"\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Allah does not look to a man who commits sodomy with a man or a woman.\" Reported by At-Tirmidhi. It is good but Gharib hadith.\nAbu Sa'id As-Su'luk said, \"There will be some people who will be called sodomites in this Ummah (nation). They are of three kinds: some who just gaze, others who just shake hands, and the last who commit the abominable act.” Reported by Al-Suyuti in Ad-Dur AI-Manthur.\nLooking at a woman or a juvenile out of sexual excitement is adultery as mentioned in the following hadith:\n\"A man commits adultery with his eyes when he looks at a strange woman,' the adultery of the ears is listening to sexual dialogue, adultery of the tongue is talking about sex,' the adultery of the hand is to catch which is unlawful,' and the adultery of the feet is going towards a strange woman; the heart ardently desires adultery,' and the sexual organs confirm or contradict the act.” Reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim.\nTherefore, the righteous men stress the necessity of keeping away from juveniles. AI-Hasan Ibn Zakwan said, \"Do not be accustomed to sit with the wealthy men's kids since they are good looking like the virgin ladies. They might be more fascinating than women.” Reported by Al-Dailami.\nOne of the earlier scholars also said, \"I do not fear a beast of prey when attacking a devout young man.\nI just fear a juvenile when sitting with him.\" More than that he said, 'A man should not sleep with a juvenile together.\" It is unlawful for a man as scholars argued, to stay alone with a juvenile in a house, a shop or a bathroom as in the case of men and women.\nAmong juveniles are those who may be more beautiful than women. He may be most fascinating. It is easy to justify what you do of evil with him than is with a woman. Therefore, such deep feelings are most likely unlawful. Numerous maxims of the early Muslims were postulated as warnings from keeping near of them.\nOnce, Sufyan Ath- Thawri entered a public bath and the a hand some boy entered after him. Sufyan said, \"Get him out because when ever I see a woman I see a Devil but whenever I see a handsome boy I see a group of devils.\"\nA man visited Imam Ahmad accompanied with a handsome boy. Imam Ahmad said, \"Who is that?\"\nThe man replied, \"My nephew.\" Imam Ahmad said, \"Do not come again with him. Nor should you walk with him lest the people who do not know you think something bad about you.\nWhen the delegate of `Abdel-Qays came to the Prophet (pbuh) there was a handsome juvenile with them. The Prophet (pbuh) made him sit behind his back and said,\n\"The trial of Dawud pertained to the gaze.” Ash-Shawkani said this hadith has no reference.\nIt was said that the look is message of adultery.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Eye-looking is a poisonous arrow of Satan and whoever gives it up for the sake of Allah, he will feel the joys of Worship which will persist until the Day of Judgement.” Reported by AI-Hakim who said that it is an authetic hadith.\nKhalid Ibn Al-Waleed (may Allah be pleased with him) related that one day he found a sodomite committing such practice. Then, Abu Bakr consulted the other Companions (may Allah bless them all `Ali Ibn Abi Talib said, \"This sin was only done by Lut's people and we knew how they were punished by Allah, the Almighty. I think he should be burnt.\" Therefore, Abu Bakr sent a message to\nKhalid ordering him to bum the sodomite. Then Khalid burnt him. \"\n'Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said, \"Whoever allows someone else to fornicate with him, he will be addicted by the appetite of woman and will be an accursed Satan in his grave until the day of Judgement.”\nIt was related that Jesus, the son of Marry (pbuh), passed by a flaming fire burning a man when he was in a journey. Then, Jesus carried Some water to extinguish the fire. But, the fire turned into a boy and the man turned into fire. Surprisingly, Jesus said, \"O Lord! May You return them back to life to ask them how they are? Allah then brought them to life. They were a man and a boy. Jesus asked them, \"Who are you?\" The man said, \"O spirit of Allah, in the World I was afflicted by loving this boy and out of sexual excitement, I sodomized him. Later on when we died, we alternatively burned one another. This is Our torture until the Day of Judgement.\"\nWe seek Allah's refuge from His torture and ask His pardon, and for well-being and guidance to\nWhat He loves and pleases.\nSodomy is also approaching a woman from the anus. This act is prohibited by Allah, the Almighty and\nHis Messenger (pbuh). Allah, the Almighty says,\n{Your wives are as a tilth unto you so approach your tilth when or how ye will but do some good act for your souls be fore hand and fear Allah, and know that ye are to meet Him (in the Hereafter) and give (these) good tidings to those who believe.}\n(AI-Baqarah: 223)\nA husband can make vaginal intercourse with his wife regardless of the posture he takes (whether it be from the front or back). The reason for the revelation of this Ayah is that Jews said in the lifetime of the Prophet (pbuh),\n\"Whenever a man makes vaginal intercourse from the back, the child will be born cross-eyed. The Companions asked the Prophet (pbuh) about that. Accordingly, Allah revealed the aforementioned Ayah to refute them.” Reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim.\nIt was related that, \"Accursed is he who approaches a woman from the anus or a fortuneteller. He who does such rejects what was revealed upon Muhammad.\" Thus, he who approaches a woman from her anus or during the menstruation period is accursed and entails such severe torture as is the fortuneteller.\nMany ignorant people fall into such sins because of their poor knowledge. Abu Ad-Darda', therefore, said, \"Be either a scholar, a disciple, a listener or one who loves knowledge otherwise you will perish.\"\nTherefore, we should repent to Allah for all our sins and faults, ask His pardon of our past ignorance, and soundness in what remains of our life span. O Allah! Grant us health and pardon in this world and the next.\nYou are the Most Merciful."

Whenever they move they fall and cannot hasten their steps like all other people.\nQatada said, \"On the Day of Judgement the usurer will be resurrected mad. Thus, all the people in the assembly will be able to identify them easily.\"\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"When I was transported from the Sacred House (of Mecca) to the farthest Mosque (of Jerusalem), I passed by some people whose bellies were protruding forward. Their bellies were as huge as houses, stretching along the way of Pharaoh's people. On the other hand, the Pharaoh's people have to be brought in front of Fire at morning and evening. Like defeated camels, deaf and mad, the people of Pharaoh used to pass by them. Feeling them coming, they attempted to keep aside but their bellies were so heavy that they could not leave and they in turn, were trodden by them. This is re-occurred in their coming and going every day. That is their lot of torture in the period of the Barrier (AI-Barzakh) up to the Last day. The Prophet asked, \"Who are they, Gabriel?\" He replied, \"They are those who devour usury will not stand except as stands one whom the Satan, by his touch, hath driven to madness.” Reported by Al-Baihiqi in the book of 'Evidence of Prophethood on the authority.\nIt was related that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"When I was taken tip in the Ascent (Mi'raj), I heard thunder and blasts in the seventh heaven.

I then, asked, 'Who are they, Gabriel?' He said, 'They are those who devour usury.” Reported by Ibn Majah. It is likely to be classified as weak.\nAbdur-Rahman Ibn Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud said,\n\"When usury and fornication appear in a community, the people of that community render themselves deserving of the punishment of Allah.” Reported by Al-Hakim who said this hadith has a good chain of transmission.\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"Whenever usury appears in a community, there will be madness. Whenever fornication appears in a community, there will be death. Whenever fraud in measure and weight appears in a community, there will be deprivation of rain.” This hadith has numerous references.\n\"The usurer suffers the torture from death up to the Day of Judgement by swimming in the Red River which is like blood and he is fed while swimmingly stones.” Reported before.\nThe stones represent the unlawful wealth he has collected in the world. He is also fed by stones (It was narrated before.) of fire like what he has swallowed of unlawful wealth in the world. This is his lot of torture in the period of Barrier before the Day of Judgement in addition to the curse of Allah.\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"Four classes of people will be prevented from entering Paradise nor will they taste its blessing as Allah decreed: the intoxicant, the usurer, the one who appropriates the orphan's property without a lawful cause and the one who was disobedient to his parents if they did not repent all.” Reported by AI-Hakim who said this hadith has a good chain of transmission.\nIt was narrated that the usurers will be resurrected in the form of dogs and pigs since they contrived for devouring usury like the people of Sabath who contrived for hunting fish by making basins in which the fish were trapped on Saturday and then were collected on Sunday. Therefore, they were turned into monkeys and pigs. Similarly, this will be the abode of those who contrive for devouring usury. However, Allah knows all what they contrive. Abu Ayub As-Sakhtiani says.” Behold! They deceive in the same manner when deceiving a child.\"\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Usury has seventy two doors, the least of them is compatible with committing adultery with one's mother.\nThe most heino[{s kind of usury is to transgress by defaming one's brother.” Postulated by AI-Haith ami in Majma' Al-Zawa'id.\nAnas related, \"The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) preached us and expounded the question of usury by saying,\n\"One Dirham gained by usury is more heinous than thirty six times of adultery at the sight of Allah.” Reported by Ibn Abi Dunya.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Usury is of seventy sins, the least of which is compatible with committing adultery with one's mother.” It has been narrated before. Abu Bakr said, \"He who takes the interest and the giver are in the Hell-Fire alike.\" Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"When indebting someone, you should not accept his gift since it is usury.\" Moreover, AI-Hasan, may Allah be pleased with him, regarded what you ate in your indebted house as Suht (taking of usury or bribes.)\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"When a loan renders an interest it is subsumed under usury.” Postulated by Ibn Hajar in :41-Matalib AI-Aliyyah' and he said it has a missing transmission.

        "description": "Allah, the Most High, says,\n{Those who unjustly eat up the property of orphans eat up fire into their own bodies: they will soon be enduring a blazing fire.}\n(Al-Nisa': 10)\nThe Qur'an also states,\n{Come not nigh to the orphan's property except to improve it, until he attains the age of full strength.}\n(Al-Imran: 152)\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"When I was taken up in Ascent (Mi'raj) I saw some men gapping their jaws under the coercion of other men. Then came another men who fed them stones of fire that penetrated their bodies and came out from their anus. I wondered: 'Who are they, Gabriel?' He replied, 'They are those who unjustly eat up the property of orphans eat up a fire intotheir bodies.” Reported by Muslim.\nIt was related that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"Allah, Most High resurrected some people from their graves with fire flaming out from their bodies and burning their faces.\" The Prophet was asked: 'Who are they, Messenger of Allah?\" He said,'\nAllah, the Almighty says, {Those who unjustly will eat up the property of orphans eat up a fire into their own bodies: they will soon be enduring a blazing fire.}\n(AI-Nisa': 10)\nAs-Sadiy, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"On the Day of Judgement, the one who appropriated an orphan's property will be resurrected with the flames of fire coming out from his mouth, ears, nose and eyes. Therefore, he will be well-identified.\" (Isma'il Ibn AbdelRahman As-Sadiy was accused of following the Shi'ah sect.)\nScholars said that there is no harm if a poor guardian of an orphan consumes some of his charge's property without exceeding what is permissible as much as he disposes and improves his business affairs.\nWhat is in excess of the permissible is absolutely unlawful (Suht)? Allah, the Almighty says,\n{If the guardian is well-off, let him claim no remuneration, but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just, reasonable. When ye release their property then, take witnesses in their presence: But all-sufficient is Allah in taking account.}\n(An-Nisa': 6)\nReasonable consuming of an orphan's property may be interpreted as: Intending the loan, fulfilling his own needs without excess, taking the wage of disposing or improving the orphan's business or intending to return what he takes out of need, if he becomes prosperous. These different points of views are mentioned by Ibn AI-Jawziy in his Tafsir (exegesis)\n\"I and one who takes care of an orphan, will enter paradise together like this\" and he raised his forefinger and middle finger jointly leaving no space betWeen them (by way of illustration).\" Reported by Al-Bukhari.\n\"I and one who takes care of an orphan, whether related to him or a stranger, will be like these two in paradise;\" and the narrator raised his forefinger and middle finger to illustrate this.” Reported by Muslim.\nThe guardianship of an orphan means to dispose his affairs: food, clothing and to improve his property if he has any. However, if he is poor, it is recommended to take care of him for the sake of Allah. In the aforementioned hadith, there is a reference that the orphan mayor may not be a relative as the Prophet says in the hadith: “related to him or a stranger”\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Whoever receives an orphan from amongst the Muslims to feed and give him drink until Allah makes him prosperous, Allah will render the Paradise binding to him unless he commits an unforgivable sin.” Reported by At- Tirmidhi.\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"Whoever wipes over an orphan's head for the sake of Allah, he will be rewarded for every hair he touched good deeds. Whoever has an orphan and treats him or her kindly, I and he will be in the Paradise like that\n(Then he combined his two fingers).” Reported by Ibn Hajar AI-Haithami Majma' AI-Zawa'id. Someone asked Abu Ad-Darda' an advice. Thus he advised him saying, \"Show mercy to the orphan, bring him nearer to you and feed him of what you eat. I heard Allah's Messenger (pbuh), when a man asked him about the harshness of his heart, saying,\n\"If you want to soften your heart, then you should bring the orphan nearer, wipe over his head and feed him of what you eat. These surely will soften your heart and enable you to do what you need.” Reported by AI-Baihiqi.\nOne of the early Muslims recounted, \"I was at first used to committing sins and drinking wine. Then, one day I received a poor orphan. I was kind to him, fed him, gave him a bath and clothed him. I treated him as tenderly as a man does with his own son and more. Afterwards, I went to sleep I dreamt that it was the day of Judgement and I was called for reckoning. Then, I was to go to Hell for my sins. I was dragged by the angels of punishment to the Fire. Meanwhile, when I was being dragged to the Fire, the orphan blocked me and said, 'O angels of my Lord, let him go. So as to intercede for him before Allah since he treated me kindly and honored me.' But the angels said; 'We were not commanded to do so.' Then came the call of Allah, \"Let him go. I forgave him because of the orphan's intercession and the kind treatment he did with him. Then, I got up and repented to Allah the High Exalted. Later on, I kept on doing my best to show mercy to orphans.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"The best of the houses is that which contains an orphan who is treated kindly and the worst of the houses is that which mistreats him. The most beloved one to Allah the Almighty is the one who offers a favor to an orphan or a widow.” Reported by Ibn Majah.\n\"Allah revealed to Dawud (pbuh): \"0 Dawud! Be a loving father to the orphan, and a kind husband to the widow. Put into your account that the more you do the more you reap. Reported by Ibn Hajar Al-Haithami in Majma' AI-Zawa'id.\nThis means that whatever you do, you will find its consequences thereafter. For example, when you die and leave a child or a widow, thy will be treated in the same manner you treated others.\nIn his soliloquy, Dawud says, \"O Allah! What is the recompense of whomever takes care of an orphan or a widow for Your Sake?\" Allah answered, \"He will be under the Shade of Mine when there will be no shade except Mine.\" i.e., the shade of the Throne on the Day of Judgement.\"\nThe following is another account that highlights the excellence of treating the orphan and the widow kindly. Once there was someone who belonged to the 'Alowiyyin sect. He lived in Balkh (a Byzantine region) and had a wife and several daughters. They were living in luxury and prosperity. Then the husband died. His widow and daughters become so poor that they moved to another town to flee from the ghost of noticing their enemies rejoice at her misfortune. Having entered the town she resorted to a deserted mosque with her daughters. Then, she went out to bring them something to eat. She passed by two people, a Muslim and a magian.\nShe started by asking the Muslim and explained to him how she suffered a lot while she was an honored woman from the 'Alawyyeen sect. But he asked her to show evidence. She said she was stranger.\nBut, he did not pay attention to her. Then, she left feeling sad and again explained her case to magian and how she had four daughters who were orphans and in need. She recounted her story to a Muslim Sheikh.\nThe magian sent his ladies to bring her and daughters home. He fed them and clothed them well. They stayed with him in luxury and honor. At midnight, the Muslim who turned the woman away dreamt that it was the Day of Judgement. A banner was risen over the Prophet's head. There was a palace of green emerald whose windows were of pearls and corundum and also had domes of pearls and corals. He then asked the Messenger of Allah: \"Whose palace is it?\" For a Muslim who believes in Allah, the One.' O\nAllah's Messenger I am a Muslim, the man said. But the prophet asked him to show the evidence that he was a Muslim.\nThe man was perplexed. Accordingly, the prophet said \"When the 'Alawiyya woman asked you, you asked her to show an evidence that she was Alawiy. Thus, show me evidence that you are Muslim. Then, the man got up sadly for repelling the woman. He started to search for her in the town until he found her in the Magian's house. He asked him about the woman and her daughters, but the Magian refused and said many blessing were showered upon him because of them.\nThe man persisted to take them and even offered the Magian a thousand dinars but he refused again.\nThe Muslim said but I should take them. Then, the Magian said, what you want is mine and the palace which you saw in your dream was created for me. May you guide me to embrace Islam? By Allah, I did not sleep yesterday before my family and I embraced Islam at the hands of the woman. I had also the same dream. The Prophet asked me, \"were the 'Alawiy woman and her daughters in your house?\" I said 'yes', Messenger Of Allah? He, then, said, the palace is for you and your family and all of you will enter Paradise. You were created a Muslim from the beginning of the creation. Then, the Muslim went away sadly.\nBehold! How Allah blesses those who treat widows and orphans tenderly in this world.\n\"He who works hard an behalf of old women and the indigent, is like a Mujahid (a warrior) in the cause of Allah and the narrator thinks, he (pbuh) added, \"and like the person standing in prayer and who never tires, and like one who observes the fast and does not break it.” Reported by Al-Bukhari."

Undoubtedly, wine is the core of abominations. Moreover, he who drinks it was cursed in various hadiths.\n\"Every intoxicant is wine and every wine is unlawful. Whoever it in the world and dies addictive to it without repentance, he will not drink it in the Hereafter.\" Reported by Muslim, Abu Dawud, At- Tirmidhi and Ahmad.\n\"Whoever drinks wine in this world it shall be forbidden for them in the next.” Reported by Al-Bukhari, An-Nisa'i and AI-Baihaqi.\n\"A drunkard is like a worshiper of an idol.\" Reported by Ibn Majah, Ahmad and Al-Baihaqi.\n\"He who shows disrespect to his parents and the drunkard will not enter Paradise.” \n \"Three people, Allah will deprive them of Paradise; the drunkard, the one who shows disrespect to his parents and the pimp who admits what his family do of abomination”. Reported by Ahmad, An-Nasa'i and AI-Hakim. Further, Allah does not accept the good deeds of a drunkard. Jabir Ibn ' Abdullah relates that the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"There are Three people from whom Allah does not accept their Prayer nor do their good deeds rise up to heaven: the fleeing slave until he returns to his masters and surrends to them, the woman who annoys her husband until he is pleased with her, and the drunkard until he becomes conscious” Ibn khuzaimah and Ai-Baihaqi.\nThe Arabic word Khamr is what befogs the mind in whatever form: soft, solid, edible or beverage. Abu Sa'id Al-Khudari related that the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Allah does not accept the Prayers from him who drinks wine so long as there is still something of it in his body” Reported by Ibn Hajar Ai-' Asqalani in 'AI-Matalib AI-Aliyyah' and reported by An-Nasa'i.\n\"Whoever drinks wine Allah never accepts what he does: Whoever is intoxicated by drinking it will not have his Prayers accepted for forty morning (days). If he repents but drinks again, Allah will make him drink from the molten brass of the Hell-fire.” This has many references; the nearest narration to it is reported by Ibn Majah and An-Nasa'i.\n\"Whoever drinks wine without being intoxicated, Allah rejects him for forty nights. If he dies during this period, he dies as an idol worshiper.” Reported by Ibn Hajar AI-Haithami in Majma' AI-Zawa'id.\n'Abdullah Ibn Awfa said, \"Whoever dies a drunkard will die as the worshiper of AI-Lat and AI-'Uzza (two idols). It is said, Do you think that the drunkard is the one who drinks it constantly? He answered, \"But he drinks it whenever he finds it even after years.” Ai-Harth mantioned it in AI-Matalb AI-'alih\nWhoever drinks wine is not considered a believer at the time of drinking. Abu Hurayrah related that the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"A thief is not a believer at the time of committing a theft. A fornicator is not a believer at the time of committing fornication, and a drunkard also is not a believer at the time of drinking as long as they have the opportunity to repent” \n\"Whoever fornicates or drinks wine, Allah takes his faith from him as a man takes a shirt off over his head.”\n \"The scent of Paradise is smelt five hundred years away but is not sensed by whomever shows disrespect to his parents, he who reminds of his charity to them, a drunkard or an idol worshiper.” Reported by Ibn Hajar Ai-Haithami in Majma' AI-Zawa'id. Imam Ahmad reported on the authority of Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari that the Prophet said,\n\"A drunkard, a believer in sorcery or he who severs his family ties will not enter Paradise. Whoever dies while drinking wine, Allah will make him drink from the river of Ghuta which is the water flowing from the genitals of the wenches. The odor of their genitals hurt all the people of the Hell-Fire.” Reported by Ai-Hakim and Ai-Baihaqi.\n\"Allah sent me as a mercy and guidance to the worlds. I was sent to do away with musical instruments, flutes, and the affairs of the pre-Islamic period of ignorance and idols. My Lord the Almighty swore by His Majesty that if one of my servants drinks a dosage of wine, I would make him drink the like of it in the Hell- Fire. But whoever gave up it out of fear from Me, I would give him drink from the yards of the shrine with the best fellow of drinking.” Reported by At- Tirmidhi who said it is a Gharib hadith.\nAs for those who are cursed because of drinking wine, Abu Dawud reported that the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Allah has cursed wine, and whoever drinks it, pours it, buys it, presses it for another, presses it for himself, carries it or accept its delivery.” Postulated by Al-Haithami in Majma' Al-Zawa'id. It is also reported by Ahmad and At-Tabarani. Ahmad reported on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Gabriel came to me and said, \"0 Muhammad, Allah has cursed wine, and whoever presses it for another, presses it for himself, drinks it, carries it, accepts its delivery, sells it buys it, pours it for another or pours it for himself.” As-Suyuti attributed it to At- Tabarani in Jami' Al-Ahadith.\nIt is unlawful to visit a drunkard when he is ill so is greeting him.\n`Abdullah Ibn 'Amr Ibn AI-As (may Allah be pleased with him) said, \"Do not visit the drunkard when being ill.\" Reported by AI-Hakim in Al-Mustadrak and attributed by Al-Suyuti to AtTabarani in Jami' Al-Ahadith.\nAI-Bukhari and Ibn 'Umar said, \"Do not greet the drunkard.\"\nThe Prophet said,\n\"Do not sit with the drunkard, visit their sick or attend their funerals. On the Day of Judgement the drunkard will be brought with a black face, and his tongue dangling on his chest, flowing with saliva.\nWhoever sees him knowing that he is a drunkard will disgust him.” Reported by Ibn Al-Jawzy in the book of forged hadiths.\nA scholar said, they are forbidden to be visited and be greeted because the drunkards are cursed and rebellious. Allah and His Messenger cursed them as mentioned before. Allah cursed wine and he who drinks it. If they buy and press it they will be cursed twice and if they pour it for another they will be cursed three times. Therefore, it is for bidden to visit or greet them unless they repent to Allah. Whoever repents to Allah. He will accept his repentance.\n Wine is forbidden as a medicine. Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) related, \"Once, one of my daughters was ill, so I made wine in a container for her. Then, the Prophet entered while it was boiling. He asked, \"What is this, Umm Salamah?\" She replied, \"It is just a medicine for my daughter.\" The Prophet, then, said,\n\"Allah has not made a cure for you in what He has prohibited to you.\" Reported by Ibn Hajar Ai-Haith ami in Majma' Al-Zawa'id and he said that it is reported by Abu Yal'la and Al-Bazzar. The transmitters upon whom Abu Ya'la relied are trustworthy.\nMiscellaneous hadiths narrated about wine:\nAbu Musa (may Allah be pleased with him) related that the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"A cask of wine was brought to the Prophet (pbuh) who said, Throw it against the wall, it is the drink of those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day.” Reported by Ibn Majah, Abu Ya'la and A1-Bazzar.\nIt is narrated that \"When the drunkards are brought to the bridge on the Fire (Sirat) they will be kidnapped by the angels of punishment to the river of Khabal. There they will drink for every glass of wine they have drunk a sip from the river of Khabal. Such a sip is so hot that if poured on to heaven, it will be burnt.\"\n Some of the sayings of the early Muslims about wine:\n\"Ibn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said, \"Whenever a drunkard dies let him be buried crucified. Then disinter his grave to find out whether he is directed to Qiblah or not. If not, let him be crucified.\"\nIt is narrated that once Al-FudailIbn Eyad visited one of his disciples when dying. He started to instruct the deceased the testification of Faith, 'there is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.\" but the disciple could not repeat after him. When Al-Fudail repeated it again the disciple said, \"I could never pronounce it. I am free of it.’ Then, Al-Fudail left weeping. Afterwards, he saw in a dream the disciple while being dragged to Fire. He asked him, \"0 poor disciple, why did you turn to ignorance?\"\nHe replied, \"0 master, when I was ill, I went to a physician who advised me to drink a glass of wine every year. It not, you would remain sick. Therefore, I used to drink it annually for treatment.\" If that is the abode of those who drink it for treatment. How about the others? When a penitent was asked, Why he repented he answered, 'I was used to entering graves. Once, I saw a dead person not directed to Qiblah. I, then, asked his kinsmen about him and they said, \"He used to drink wine in the world and died without doing repentance. One of the righteous men said, \"Having buried one of my kids, I saw him in a dream with a white hairy head. I asked, 0 my kid, I had buried you as a child, what happened to you?\" A drunkard was buried beside me, father. Then Hell-Fire received him by just a puff. It was so violent that all children grew white hairy.\nHence, we should repent to Allah the Almighty before dying disobedient and then cast into the Fire. We seek Allah's refuge from it.\nHashish which is made from marijuana is like wine. It is unlawful and whoever smokes it should suffer the same penalty of a drunkard. Actually it is worst than wine. As it affects one's mind and perception to the extent that he may turn into effeminate or a pimp etc. Wine is also most abominated as it often leads to disagreement and fighting and they in turn take the Muslim away of Prayer and remembrance of Allah. Some earliest scholars held that who eats or smokes hashish should be disciplined but such disciplinary action may not reach the amount of the least prescribed legal penalty. This is because they considered it as something that befogs mind but not desired like narcotics Nevertheless, hashish is something which is desired and it is hard for the addict to renounce it. Therefore, he who eats or smoke it should be penalized like the one who drinks wine.\nBecause hashish is solid the scholars are not unanimous as to whether it is filthy or not. There are three points of views as shown in the Hanbali school of jurisprudence and others: It is as filthy as wine and this is the correct point of view.\nIt is not filthy due to its solidity. Solid hashish is pure but liquid hashish is filthy.\nOnce, Abu Musa asked, \"0 Messenger of Allah what is the ruling of Bit' and Mizr (two intoxicants beverages made in Yemen). The former is made of honey and the lather is made of barely. He added, the Prophet is so eloquent. The Prophet answered,\n“Every intoxicant that causes the negligence of Prayer is forbidden.” Reported by Muslim.\n\"Of that which intoxicates in a large amount, a small amount is unlawful.” Reported by At- Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, Abu Dawud and Ahmad.\nIn the hadith above, there is no reference to the dichotomy of intoxicants into solid or liquid.\nWhatever the kind or form of an intoxicant, it is unlawful. Hashish is not mentioned by the early Muslims because it was used only after the coming of Tatars to the Islamic world.\nAbdul-Malik Ibn Marawan recounted a story about a young man who came to him weeping because of a sin he committed. The young man asked: Is repentance available to me? Abdul-Malik said, “What did you commit of sins? I committed a grievous sin, the man declared. Abu Malik said, \"You would better repent to Allah Who accepts the repentance of His servants and forgives all sins.\" Then, the young man said, \"O leader of the believers, I was used to robbing graves. There I have seen many wondrous scenes. He asked him: \"What did you see?\" He said, \"One night I robbed a grave where I noticed the corpse not directed to Qiblah. I was scared and started to leave but I heard someone saying, \"Would not you ask why he was turned away from Qiblah? Why, I asked. He said, “Because he was not serious in Prayer.”\nWhen I stole from another grave I noticed that the corpse was turned into a pig and his neck tied by chains. I was scared and attempted to leave, but I heard someone saying, \"would not you ask about his deeds, and why he was tortured?\" I asked why?\" He said, \"He drank wine in the world and died without doing repentance.\nIn the third grave I saw that the corpse was spinned into the earth by wedges of fire and that the tongue was pierced to the back of his head. I became scared and tried to go back but someone called me by saying,’ “Would you like to know why he was tortured?” I asked. “Why”? He said, \"He did not free himself of traces of urine and was a talebearer.”\nIn the fourth grave, I saw that the corpse blazing in fire. I was scared and attempted to leave but I was called would you like to know why he was tormented. I asked, “Why?” He replied he neglected prayers.\nEventually, I stole from a fifth grave which was so wide as far as one's sight and shiny. The corpse was lying on a bed illuminated and well dressed. I honored him and tried to leave but someone called me saying, \"would you like to know why he was honored?\" \"Why? I asked .\" He said, \"He was a devout young man who was brought obeying and worshipping Allah.\" Then Abdul-Malik commented, \"This is a lesson to the sinful men and a good tiding to the devout people. May Allah count you and us among the devout and obedient people and let us be protected from the wrongdoing. He is the Most Generous, the Most Bounteous."

Intoxicants and gambling, sacrificing to stones, and (divination by) arrows, are an abomination, of Satan's handiwork: eschew such (abomination) that ye may prosperO0 Satan's plan is (but) to excite enmity and hatred between you, with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah, and from prayer: will ye not then abstain?}\n(5:90-91)\nGambling connotes backgammon, chess and speculation by nuts, balls, stones and all kinds of betting. It ranks under encroaching upon people's rights that Allah has made forbidden in His saying,\n{And do not eat up your property among yourselves for vanities, nor use it as bait for the judges, with intent that ye may eat up wrongfully and knowingly a little of (other) people's property.}\n(2:188)\nIt was also referred to in the Prophetic saying,\n\"Some people spend Allah's wealth (i.e. Muslim's Wealth) in an unjust manner, such people will be put in the (Hell) fire on the day of resurrection” Reported by A1-Bukhari and Ahmad.\n\"The one who invites his companions: Come let us gamble”, should (expiate his sin) by giving in charity.” Reported by AI-Bukhari.\nSince the mere willingness to gamble requires expiation, what would be the sin of the real practice of gambling? The Muslim scholars have differed about the exact legal ruling on backgammon and chess in case of being played free from betting. However, the preponderant opinion is to prohibit backgammon.\nThey established their view on the Prophetic saying,\n\"He who played backgammon is like one who dyed his hand with the flesh and blood of swine\" Reported by Muslim.\n\"He who played backgammon has disobeyed Allah and His Messenger.” Reported by Ibn Majah.\nIbn ' Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated,\n\"Backgammon is (a kind of) gambling, and (is sinful) as eating the pork, and playing it without betting is (as prohibited) as embrocating with the swine's fat.\"\nRegarding chess, with or without betting, it is viewed as forbidden by most jurists, for if it includes betting, there is originally no difference of opinion concerning its prohibition. But in case it is void of betting, the prohibition stands more preferable.\nHowever, according to a narration of Imam Shaffi'i, if it is played in privacy and does not take one's mind away from obligations or observing prayer on its due time, it is regarded allowable.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) when asked about chess said, \"Most scholars held it forbidden. In case it leads to the negligence of prayer on time or includes betting, it is strictly forbidden.\nOtherwise, it may be considered abominable\"\nThe basic proof to prohibit chess by most jurists is derived from Allah's saying,\n{Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine... The division (of meat) by raffling with arrows.}\n(Al-Ma'idah: 3)\nSufyan and Waki' Ibn Al-Jarrah interpreted \"The division (of meat) by raffling with arrows as to refer to chess.\n`Ali Ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) said, \"Chess is the gambling game of the \"Ajam\"- Non Arabs. He has also passed by a group of people playing chess and said to them, \"What are these idols to which you are dedicating yourselves in worship? To touch a firebrand until it gets quenched is better than touching such idols.” Reported by Ibn Kathir. \nHe added, \"By Allah, it is not the purpose for which you have been created\". On another occasion he said, \"He who plays chess is a great liar. You say to your fellow player. “You are dead”, while he is not so”. Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari said, \"No one plays chess except the sinful person\". It was said to Yzhaq Ibn Rahwayh: \"Is there something in playing chess?” Reported by AI-Suyuti.\nHe answered, \"It is wholly sinful\". When he was informed that the soldiers in camps were used to playing it as a means of training for war, he said, \"It is impiety.\" Muhammad Ibn Kab Al-Karzi commented, \"The least punishment that a chess player will suffer on the Day of Resurrection is to be gathered with the wrong- doers\". Concerning chess Ibn 'Umar said, \"It is more mischievous than backgammon.\" And a similar narration with the same effect was quoted from Imam Malik. It is mentioned that Ibn 'Abbas was appointed as the guardian of the property of an orphan. Among that property there existed a chess game.\nThereupon, Ibn Abbas set that game on fire. Hence, if it was permitted to play that game, Ibn Abbas would not have destroyed it, since it was property of an orphan. Accordingly, the prohibition of chess is measured to that of wine. Ibrahim AI-Nakha'i said about chess: \"It is cursed\". Abu Bakr AI-Athram in his collection mentioned the Prophetic saying, \"Daily Allah has three hundred and sixty looks which comprehend all his creatures except the sheep player- i.e. chess player- for he says\" check-mate.”\nAbu Bakr AI-Ajiri related the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) saying,\n\"If you pass by those who play with these idols i.e. backgammon and chess and other amusement -do not greet them. For when they gather and are up to their elbows in playing, Satan alone with his fellows attend their game. And if one of the players averted his glance from playing, Satan would thrust him -to turn again\n to playing thus, they keep playing till they disperse. They are like a group of dogs that come across a cadaver, eat of it till they are fed up and then go away. In addition, the chess player usually commits lying, as he says, \"mate\"\nMujahid said, \"Every man when he is dying views his fellowmen whom he used to accompany. One day, a man who was used to playing chess was at the point of death. When he was asked to pronounce the Shahadah -declaration of faith- he instead said,\" mate\" and died.\nHis tongue was wrenched by the words he used to say in his life. The Prophet (pbuh) said, \"Everyone dies in the same manner as he lives and is resurrected in the same manner as he dies” Reported by Muslim."

The unjust accuser in all the above cases must suffer eighty stripes unless he brings a testimony of four men who support his allegation. Otherwise, he must be flogged with eighty lashes upon the request of the offended person.\nThe Prophet, too, forbade a man to wrongfully accuse his bondman or his slave girl of committing adultery.\nA person who accuses his maid servant with adultery, will be subjected to the punishment of slandering on the Day of Judgement unless he happens to be true\"\nA lot of ignorant people are indulged in such offenses which procure the chastisement in this world and in the hereafter.\nWhen a person says something unknowingly right or wrong, it may lead him to fall down in hell as far away as the distance between the east and west.\nMu'az b.

Allah's apostle said,\" No, by him in whose hand is my soul, he had a sheet (of cloth) which he had taken (illegally) on the day of Khaibar from the booty before its distribution and has become a flame of fire burning him.” On hearing that, a man brought one or two leather straps of shoes to the Prophet and said, \"These are the things I took (illegally)”\n“This is a strap, or these are two straps, of fire\", the Prophet said.” Reported by Al-Bukhari.\n`Abdullah Ibn ' Amr related,\n\"There was a man who looked after the family and the belongings of the Prophet was called \"Karkarah.\"\nThe man died and Allah's apostle said,\" He is in the Hell fire.

Injustice, generally speaking, may be classified into three categories:\na) To violently spoil one's property.\nb) To act tyrannically by unjustly killing, beating or wounding people.\nc) To aggressively insult, curse, slander and ill-treat people. The Prophet, while being at \"Mina\" gave a sermon that ended:\n\"0 People!

Hence, to take arms against a Muslim stands for fighting with Allah and his Messenger. Such an opinion was held by Imam Malik, Imam Shafi'i, and AI-Awza'i.\nAs to Allah's saying, \"Execution............... Or exile from the land\", AI-Wahidi said from Ibn 'Abbas that \"or\" in this verse is used for giving the choice and permissibility. Hence, the Imam- the Muslim leader has the full option to enforce killing, or crucifixion or banishment. AI-Hasan, Sa'id fun AIMusayyab, and Mujahid supported this view.\nAccording to another narration through' Atiyyah, AI- W alibi said, \"or\" in the verse is not for permissibility, but it rather signifies the order of the legal rule \"Hukm\" in regard to the variant crimes. In other words, those who murder and plunder property must be killed and crucified. Those who only rob property, their hands and feet must be cut off and those who violently shed blood but do not rob property must be put to death. Finally, those who scare people in their ways but do not commit murder must be exiled from the land. Imam Shafi'i is quoted to hare the some previous view. He is mentioned as saying,” Each criminal is judged according to his/her offense. So, in case of killing and crucifixion, the evildoer should first be put to death lest he is painfully tortured. Then, he is crucified for three consecutive days and then let down.\nIn case of killing only, the criminal is executed and his corpse is to be handed to his kinsmen to be buried.\nIf the sentence of cutting off of hands or feet, the right hand is first to be lopped off and cauterized. If he returned to theft, his left leg should be severed. In the third time, his left hand should be amputated.\nConcerning the cutting off of thieves' hands and feet the Prophet said,\n\"If someone committed theft cut off his hand, if he stole a second, cut off his leg, if he stole once again, cut off his (other) hand if he insisted on stealing, cut off his (other) leg.” Reported by Abu Dawud.\nAbu Bakr and 'Vmar (May Allah be pleased with them all) were unanimously used to inflict such a legal rule upon thieves. Allah's saying\" From opposite sides\" illustrated the contrasting order in cutting off of a hand at then a leg.\nIbn 'Abbas in his exegesis of Allah's saying {Or exile from the land } made open that if the thief is out of control, the Imam should pass a command to shed his blood in vain. But if he is under arrest, exile connotes imprisonment that restricts and hinders his freedom."

Should they fall short of his aggression, then the aggrieved person' sins and misdeeds will be transformed from them to him, and he will be thrown into the fire (Hell).\" Reported by Muslim and At-Tirmidhi.\nHe also said,\n\"Beware, from the curse of the oppressed as there is no screen between his invocation and Allah.” Reported by Muslim. And\n\"Whoever usurps even one span of the land of somebody, his neck will be encircled with it down to the seven earths on the Day of Resurrection.” Reported by AI-Bukhari.\nAllah the Almighty is quoted in a holy tradition, saying,\n\"My anger is so agitated against those who oppress another person that has none for support except Me.” Reported in AI-Muqasid AI-Hasanah.\nSome of the righteous ancestors were always reciting, \"Do not oppress the weak persons lest you might be of the most violent of the strongest ones.\"\nAbu Hurairah was quoted saying, \"Verily, the bustard dies in its nests fearing from the oppressors.\nThe Torah states, \"Someone calls from behind the Path (Sirat), \"O tyrant oppressors! O damned luxuriant! Allah, indeed, swears by His Might and Majesty that no oppressor will tread that path this Day-\n(Day of Doom).\nJabir narrated,\n\"When the people who had migrated to Ethiopia came back home and met with Allah's Apostle, he asked them saying, \"Would you, please, inform me with some of the wonders you have experienced in the Ethiopian territories?\" Whereupon some young men replied, \"We would, O Allah's Apostle\". They added,\n\"While we were sitting, an old monastic woman bearing a jug of water on her head passed by us. Then, an Ethiopian young boy appeared and put his hand at her back and pushed her. As a result, she fell and her jug broke. When she stood up she angrily rebuked him saying,\" \"0, treacherous! When Allah sets up His Throne, assembles the former and latter (generation), and when hands and feet shall confess what they had produced, then you will realize the (consequences of that) situation between you and me before Him (Allah)\"\nThe narrator said, \"Allah's Apostle commented, crying, \"She really spoke the truth: how does Allah bless people whose weak persons can not retaliate from the strong ones .” Reported by Ibn Majah.\nThe Prophet said,\n\"Five (persons) deserve Allah's wrath and He has the full choice to chastise them in this world, or to adjourn their case to the Hereafter so that they shall return to the HellFire:\na) A people's ruler who receives his full right of his subjects but does not fulfill their rights from himself or guard them against himself,\nb) A people's commander whom they obey but he does not observe equality between the strong and the weak, and he talks in vain,\nc) A man who does not bid his wife and children to fulfil their duty to Allah, or teach them the affairs of their religion,\nd) A man who has engaged the services of someone but did not pay him and\n 'Abdullah Ibn Salam related, \"After Allah the Almighty had perfected the creation of mankind, they got up on their feet and directed their gazes towards the sky, saying, \"O Lord! Whom would you give your help?\" Allah declared, \"I would grant My Help upon the offended until he gets his due right.\"\n Wahb Ibn Munabih narrated, \"A tyrant king had built a palace for himself. Later, a poor old woman came and made a small hut of twigs beside the palace to reside therein. One day, while the king was wandering round the palace, he saw the hut. Angrily, he asked his servants, \"Whose hut is this?\" Once he was informed that it was owned by a poor woman, he gave a command to remove it. As the poor woman came and saw her hut in ruins, she questioned with sorrow, \"Who has demolished my hut?\" She was answered, \"It was the king\". At this moment she directed her face forward the sky and invoked Allah, saying, \"O Lord! I was actually absent (when my hut was destroyed) but You are never absent!\" At the time of her Du'a' Allah revealed to Gabriel to turn the palace upside down.\"\nKhalid Ibn Barmak along with his son had once suffered imprisonment. Remembering the past days, the son said, \"O father! After the luxuriant days we had, now we are in jail\". His father replied, \"O son! We paid no attention to the offender's invocation which Allah received and did not neglect\".\nZaid Ibn Hakim related, \"I felt timid before no one except one whom I have wronged, knowing that he has none to defend him except Allah. And he says to me, \"Sufficient for me is Allah, Allah is (the Judge) between you and me.\"\nAbu Umamah related, \"On the Day of Judgement, the oppressors shall meet with their victims on the board of Hell. They shall recognize each other and remember their situation in this world. So, the offended would not allow their oppressors to pass unless they take of their good deeds (as compensation). If their good deeds ran out, the sins of the oppressed persons would be loaded on the oppressors.” Reported in At-Targhib wa At-Tarhib.\n`Abdullah Ibn Unais narrated the Prophet say,\n\"Allah will gather his worshipers on the Day of Judgement bare-footed, naked and uncircumcised. Then, a caller whose voice would reach near and far says, \"I am the sovereign, I am the Judge. None of the dwellers of Hell shall enter it, and none of the dwellers of Paradise shall enter it with a misdeed until I castigate upon him, even in regard to a slap 'and what is more.\" Allah says, {And not one will thy lord treat with injustice} (AI-Kahf:49)\nThen, the Companions asked,\nHow could we retaliate, while we will be summoned bare-footed, 'O Allah's Apostle?' He answered: 'By the good deeds and sins, which is a fitting recompense.’ {And not one will thy lord treat with injustice.}” Musnad of Imam Ahmad. Kisra, the king of the Persians, had adopted an instructor to educate and culture his child. As soon as the child had attained the highest level of refinement and education, the instructor brought him only to harshly beat him for no reason. The child committed this situation to his memory until he came of age and succeeded the throne of his father as a king. One day, he sent for his old instructor to inquire from him about the reason for which he beat him. The instructor said,' Your Majesty! Just as you have got the most refined manners of culture and merits, I became sure that you would succeed your father and be a king.\nHence, I intended to let you taste beating and oppression so as to abandon it in dealing with your subjects\".\nThe little king replied \"God bliss you!\" He gave an order that he (the instructor) would be rewarded.\nThe Prophet said,\n\"The invocation of the offended person ascends through the clouds. And Allah responds to it saying, \"By My Might and Sovereignty, I will give you victory, even after a while.” Reported in Majma' Al-Zawa'id.\nOf the most detestable forms of Persian is procrastination in repaying one's due debts, while being able.\nThe Prophet said,\n\"Procrastination (delay) in repaying debts by a wealthy person is injustice.” Reported by A1-Bukhari.\n\"The delay in the payment of debt by one who can afford to pay is injustice that justifies his defamation and torture by the lender.” Reported by Abu Dawud and An-Nasai'.\nDefamation means that the lender tells him in public that he has delayed the payment. Torture stands for legal imprisonment.\n\nTo deprive a woman of her due dowry, expenditures and draping is a form of injustice. 'Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud says, \"Each man and woman on the Day of Resurrection will be openly shown before all creatures, and it will be said, This is so-and-so. Let those who have a claim of something over him come and get it back\". Hence, the Prophet said, \"Women shall rejoice as they regain their due rights from their fathers, brothers or husbands. Then,' Abdullah Ibn Ma'sud recited, {There will be no more relationships between them that day, nor will one ask after another} (AI-Mu'minun: 101)\nHe added, \"Allah will then be tolerant with him in regard to his Own due rights, but not so in the people's. Thereupon, such a man or woman will be set up and Allah will say to the owners of the rights\n\"Come and take back your rights.” Accordingly, Allah will command the angels, saying, \"Take of his/her good deeds and give every right owner his/her due.\" In case such a man or woman is righteous and there is a little bit of his good deeds left behind, Allah will multiply it manifolds so as to admit him to Paradise. But if he was a wretched person, and nothing of his good deeds remains, the angels would say, \"O Lord! His good deeds are over and he is still indebted, so, Allah will say, \"Take of their sins and load on him.\"\nFinally, such a man will be cast into the Fire.\"\nTo employ a laborer and not to pay him is a type of injustice. The Prophet mentioned Allah say,\n\"I will be an opponent to three types of people on the Day of Resurrection:\na) One who makes a covenant in my name, but proves treacherous,\nb) One who sells a free person and eats his price,\nc) And one who employs a laborer and takes full work from him but does not pay him for his labor.” Reported by AI-Bukhari and Ibn Majah.\nThe same rule is dispensed if a Muslim committed any injustices against a Jew or a Christian, for it is subject to Allah's saying, I am His opponent.\" It also applies if someone took an oath regarding a debt upon himself and he was lying.\nThe Prophet said,\n\"Allah has decreed the fire of Hell for a person who usurps the property of a Muslim through false oath and debarred him from Paradise.” A Companion asked, \"0 Messenger of Allah! Even if it is a worthless something?” The Prophet replied, \"Even if it be the twig of a bush.” Reported by At -Tirmidhi and Muslim.\nVerily, the most abominable thing before a man's eye on the Day of Resurrection is to face the one whom he had oppressed in this life and who will sue for retaliation.\nThe Prophet said,\n\"Allah will definitely enforce the settlement of all the dues to those entitled to receive them on the Day of Judgement, even the wrong done to a hornless goat by a horned one will be redressed.” Reported in Majam' Al-Zawa'id.\nThe Prophet said,\n\"The first to dispute with each other on the Day of Resurrection are a husband and his wife. By Allah, her tongue will not speak but her hands and feet shall bear witness against her in regard to what she used to mar for her husband in this world. Whereas man's hands and feet shall be witnesses against him for what good and bad he has treated his wife with. Later, a man will face a similar position concerning his servants. On this occasion, no \"Qirats\" or \"Dawaniqs\" shall be available (as a compensation), but the oppressors good deeds shall be granted to the offended, and the offended persons' sins shall be loaded on the oppressors. Then, the tyrants would be brought in funnels and led to the fire.”1\nShareih, the Judge, used to say, \"The oppressors shall indeed, recognize the offender's right, for the oppressor is waiting for chastisement, while the oppressed will have victory and reward.\nIt has been even related that when Allah wills good for one of His servants, He sets him open to oppression by someone. One day, Taus AI- Yamani entered at Hisham Ibn AI-Malik and said to him,\n\"Observe your duty towards Allah lest He may punish you on the Day of (Adhan) Call! Hisham asked,\n\"What is the Day of Adhan\"? So, Taus recited Allah's saying,\n{A Crier shall proclaim between them: \"The curse of Allah is on the wrongdoers.} (AI-' Araf: 44)\nAs a result Hisham got stupefied. Thereupon, Taus concluded, \"This is merely the humiliation of the description, how shameful is the humiliation of the practical commitment.” 2\n0 you who is content to be an oppressor! How many wrong deeds are yours? The prison on the Day of Judgment is Hell, and the Judge is the Truth (Allah).\nAvoid being in the wrongdoers' presence, treating and helping them.\nAllah says,\n{And incline not to those who do wrong, or the fire will touch you, and you have no protectors other than Allah, nor shall you be helped.} (Hud:113)\nInclination here stands for being tranquil and pleased with them. In the exegesis of this verse Ibn '\nAbbas commented, \"Do not be over inclined to them in love, talking and attachment. AI-Sadiyy and Ibn Zaid assimilated it as, \"Not to flatter the oppressors.\"\nAkrimah added, \"To obey and try to gain favor with them.\" Allah says,\n{Bring ye up \"It shall be said” the wrongdoers and their spouses, and the things they worshipped.} (As-Saffat: 22)\nThe Prophet said,\n\"There will be commanders attended by servants , and suits who may do mischief and commit lying.\nWhosoever attaches to them, believed their lying and supported them in their injustice does not belong to me and I do not belong to him. And whosoever avoided their gatherings and did not associate with them belongs to me and I belong to him. \"\nHe said too,\n1 AI-Du'afa'by AI-Aqili.\n2 AI-Jami' AI-Azhar.\n\"Whosoever stands for an oppressor will be afflicted by him.” AI-Jami' AI-Saghir.\nSa'id Ibn Al-Mussayyab mentioned, \"Do not stare the wrongdoers in the face except with disapproval (against their misdeeds), lest your good deeds come to nothing.\"\nMakhul Ad-Dimashqi related, \"On the Day of Judgement there will be a caller who proclaims where are the oppressors and their assistants?\" Accordingly, everyone who might have brought him ink, fill in their inkwells, or even get their pens nibbled will be gathered with them. Whereupon they shall be assembled together in a box of fire and be thrown in Hell.\"\nOne day, a sailor came to Suffyan Al- Thauri and said, \"I sew the sultan's dresses. Am I then one of the oppressors' assistants? Suffyan replied, \"You are, by this of the very oppressors. By the oppressors assistants are, even those who buy needles and thread.\"\nThe Prophet said,\n\"The first to tread the fire on the Day of Judgement are the worshipers who unjustly lash people with the order of the oppressors.”\nIt is related that Allah revealed to Moses that his people should recite nothing of Allah's divine revelation. The reason was that Allah (was angry with them and) always mentions whoever invokes Him. Allah's mentioning of them was by way of cursing them.\"\nHe also said,\n\"Let none of you remain indifferently witnessing a situation wherein an innocent person is wrongfully treated and beaten. For, the curse of Allah then inflicts whomsoever attend but did not defend him.” Reported in Majrna' AI-Zawa'id.\nHe said too,\n\"The angels have raised a dead man from his tomb and said to him.\n\"We are going to beat you with a hundred blows. So, he kept interceding with them until the number decreased down to only one blow. Once they hit him, the tomb got ignited. Then he asked the, \"Whey did you hit me\". They answered \"you have observed a Prayer without performing the vital ablution, and you have witnessed a wronged man but did not help him.” Reported in At-Targhib waAt-Tarhib.\nSuch is the state of an able man who denied supporting an offended person. Then, what about the oppressors themselves?\nThe Prophet said,\n\"Help your brother whether he is an oppressor or oppressed person. A companion asked, \"Messenger of Allah! (It is true) I will help him if he is an oppressed person, but please, tell me how I am to help him if he happens to be an oppressor!\" The Prophet answered, \"Prevent him from doing injustice. Because preventing him from committing aggression is a help to him.” Reported by A1-Bukhari and Muslim.\nOne of the pious scholars related, \"A man who was used to serve the supporter and tax collectors came to me in my dream. He appeared in a very miserable state. I asked him, \"How are1you?\" He answered, \"Very bad.\" I said, \"Where were you led?' \"To the chastisement decreed by Allah.\" He replied, \"I questioned him further, \"How do the wrong-doers fell before Him (Allah)?\" He answered, \"Have not you recited Allah's saying,\n{And soon will the unjust know what vicissitudes their affairs will take!} (Ash-Shu'ara': 227) Someone related saying, \"I saw a man whose arm was amputated, loudly announcing, \"Let each person who has witnessed me act unjustly against none!\" I approached him and said, \"O brother! Tell me, please, about your case!\" He replied, \"My case is so astonishing. I used to serve the suppressors. One day, I came across a fisherman who had just caught a big fish that appealed to me. I ordered him to give it to me, but he refused. He said he would sell it and get some food for his children. So, I hit him violently, got the fish and left ahead.\nWhile I was walking down the street, with the fish in my hand, it bit my thumb so severely. When I got home, and as I set it down on the table, it hit my thumb once again so painfully that I could not sleep that night. My hand began to swell. In the morning, I went to a doctor to check it, and he told me that my thumb suffered from gangrene and it has to be cut off, lest the infection might reach the rest of my hand. So, I let him cut my thump off. After a while, my hand started to hurt me so much, and I was advised to cut it off, and I did. Bit by bit, the gangrene took me so ill that I had to amputate my whole arm up to the scapula.\nWhen I mentioned this story to some people they commented saying if I had gone from the beginning to the fisherman and asked him to pardon me I would not have suffered all this fatigue. And they bade me to go at once after that fisherman and beg his forgiveness.\nI left right away searching of him until I found him. Whereupon I kneeled down kissing his feet asking for his tolerance. He said to me, \"Who are you?\" I answered, \"I am the man who had unjustly taken away your fish.\" Then, I got him acquainted with what happened to me.\nAs he saw my arm he wept deeply and said, \"O brother! I have pardoned you.\"\nI asked, \"Have you invoked Allah against me when I took your fish?' he replied, \"yes! I supplicated to Allah saying, \"O Lord! That man has unjustly abused his strength and deprived me of what You have provided for me. So, let me, please, observe Your Might by punishing him!\"\nAt this moment I said, \"O sir! You have indeed got your demand, and I will never serve the transgressors as long as I am alive.\""

        "description": "Allah, Glorified and Exalted be He, cautions us saying,\n{And do not eat up your property among yourselves for vanities.} (Al-Baqarah: 188)\nThe verse means that Muslims are commanded by Allah to avoid taking the property of each other’s through illegal means. Abdullah Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said, “What is meant in the verse are the false oaths through which a person takes the property of another with no right.”\nThe consumption of Haram is of two kinds:\n1) Taking another’s property through oppression such as in cases of treachery and robbery.\n2) Taking other’s property through unlawful forms of sports and games such as gambling and the lottery.\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) has condemned the consumption of the Haram in many hadiths. Here, we will quote the following hadiths to explain the gravity of this heinous sin:\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n“Some people spend Allah’s wealth (i.e., the Muslims’ wealth) in an unjust manner; such people will be put in the Hell on the Day of Judgment.” (Bukhari)\n“… Then he mentioned (the case of) a man who, having journeyed far, is disheveled and dusty and who spreads out his hands to the sky saying, 0 Lord! 0 Lord! While his food is unlawful, his drink unlawful, his clothing unlawful, and he is nourished unlawfully, how can he be answered?” (Muslim)\nAnas (may Allah be pleased with him) said to the prophet (peace and blessing be upon him) ‘O Messenger of Allah! Supplicate to Allah for me to make my Du’a’ acceptable.” The Messenger (pbuh) replied,\n“O Anas! To have an acceptable Du’a’, you should eat only the Halal (Lawful) since a person may be deprived of his Dua’ being answered for forty days because of eating a mouthful of Haram food.” (Al-Asfahani in Al-Targhib)\n“Allah has decreed your behavior as He has decreed your provision. Surely, Allah grants the joys of this world to those whom He loves and those whom He loves not, but He does not grant religion except to those whom He loves. Therefore, those who are blessed with religion receive Allah’s Love. Assuredly, no one earns Haram money but what he spends, gives as charity or leaves behind will be his fuel in Hell-fire. Verily Allah does not obliterate evil by means of evil, but He obliterates evil by means of good. .” (Ahmad)\n“This worldly life is joyful and attractive. Therefore, whoever earns property through lawful means and spends it in a legal manner, Allah will reward him with Paradise. On the other hand, whoever earns property through unlawful means and spends it in illegal ends, Allah will make him dwell in the abode of humiliation (Hell). Some people also spend Allah’s wealth in an unjust manner according to their whims. Such people will be put in the Hell on the Day of Judgment.” (Ibn Hibban)\n“Whoever pays no attention to the sources of his money, Allah will not concern about which gate he would enter Hell-Fire.”\nAbu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported a hadith that reads,\n“To fill his mouth with dust is better to a person than putting Haram things in it.” (Ahmad)\nYusuf Ibn Asbat (may Allah bestow mercy on him) said, “When a young man dedicates his life to worship, Satan asks his assistants about the source of his livelihood. If it is Haram, Satan says, ‘Don’t bother about his worship and dedication for his consumption of the Haram is sufficient to make his work null and void.’” This means that worship will be of no avail when the worshiper insists on eating Haram.\nThis meaning is maintained by the aforementioned Hadith that,\n“… A man who, having journeyed far, is disheveled and dusty and who spreads out his hands to the sky (saying), ‘O Lord! O Lord!’ while his food is unlawful, his drink unlawful, his clothing unlawful, and he is nourished unlawfully, how can he be answered?” (Muslim)\nIt is reported in the hadith that,\n“Every day and night, an angel calls upon people from above Jerusalem\n‘Whoever indulges in eating Haram, Allah will never accept his optional or obligatory acts of worship.”\n‘Abdullah Ibn Al-Mubarak said, “Keeping myself clean from consuming a doubtful dirham is more charitable to me than giving 100,000 dirhams in charity.”\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n“When the pilgrim, who journeys to Hajj, by Haram money, says. ‘Here I am! At your service.” Our Lord, here I am! At your service. Allah will say to him, “your calling is rejected and your Hajj is valueless.” (lbn Hajar)\nHe (pbuh) also said,\n“Whoever purchases a garment by ten dirhams which contain a Haram dirham, Allah never accepts his prayer as long as he wears this garment.” (Ahmad)\nWuhaib Ibn Al-Ward said, “If you were to stand in Prayer equally as this column stands in the mosque, it would be of no avail until you take care about your livelihood, i.e., to verify what is lawful from what is Haram.”\nIbn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said, “Allah never accepts the Prayer of a man who feed on Haram until he repents.”\nSimilar to the one who spends unlawful money in disobedience of Allah is the one who purifies his garment by urine. Assuredly, only water can purify one’s garment just only as the lawful can obliterate sins.”\n‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “We used to abstain from nine tenths of Halal lest it may contain a Haram.”\nKa’b Ibn ‘Ayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) to have said,\n“A body that is nourished unlawfully will not enter paradise.” (Tabarani)\nZaid Ibn Arqam reported that, “Abu Bakr had a slave who used to give him some of his earnings. Abu Bakr used to eat from it. One day he brought something and Abu Bakr ate from it. The slave said to him, ‘Do you know what is this?’ The slave said, ‘Once, in the Pre-Islamic Period of ignorance I told somebody’s future though I did not know this knowledge of foretelling but I cheated him, and when he met me, he gave me something for that service, and that is what you have eaten from. Then Abu Bakr put his hand in his mouth and vomited whatever was present in his stomach.” Later on, Abu Bakr was asked, “O Abu Bakr! Have you done all this because of a Haram mouthful?” He replied, “By Allah! If I were to perish myself to get this mouthful out of me, I would have no hesitation to do so because I heard the Messenger of Allah say,\n‘Everybody that is nourished unlawfully, Hell would be his abode.” (Bukhari)\nHowever, the Muslim scholars state that the consumption of Haram includes various major sins such as treachery, oppression, robbery, usury, taking the orphan’s property with no right, false witness, bribery, deception, gambling, sorcery, foretelling, adultery, fornication, and the practice of wailing, lamenting and showing excessive grief for the dead.\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n“On the Day of Judgment, there will come some people with righteous deeds which are as huge as the Mount of Tuhamah. These righteous deeds would be soon scattered and invalidated. Consequently, those people would be thrown into Hell-fire.” The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) wondered, “O Messenger of Allah! How would this happen!” He (pbuh) replied, “Those people used to perform Prayer, fast, gives Zakah and offer Hajj, but they used to consume Haram so Allah invalidated their righteous deeds.” (Tabarani)\nIt is narrated that a righteous man was seen in a vision after his death and was asked about his affair.\nThereupon this man explained, “Fine! But I have been prevented from entering Paradise because of a needle which I borrowed in my life and did not give it back to its owner.”"

        "description": "Allah Most High states,\n{And kill not one another. Surely, God is Compassionate to you, but whosoever does that in transgression and wrongfully, him We shall certainly roast at afire! and that for God is an easy matter.}\n(An-Nisa': 29-30)\nIn his explanation to these two verses, AI-Wahidy stated, {And kill not one another,} Muslims are prohibited to murder each other because they are adherents to one religion, Islam. Therefore they are like a single person. This is the opinion of Ibn `Abbas and the majority of scholars. However other scholars are of the opinion that the prohibition in this verse is restricted to suicide. To support their opinion, the latter group of scholars quotes the following \" Abu Mansour Ibn Muhammad AI-Mmsuri narrated' Arnr Ibn AI-\n`Aas saying, \"In the battle of Zatt Al-Salasil, I had a wet dream on a cold night. The weather was so cold that I feared becoming ill if I had had a shower. Therefore, I performed dry ablution (Tayamum) and led my companions in the Dawn Prayer. On our return to Medina, the Prophet (pbuh) said to me, 'O `Arnr! \"Have you led your companions in Prayer while you were in a state of major impurity?\" Then I responded, \"O Messenger of Allah! I read the verse, {And kill not one another! Surely God is Compassionate to you.} i.e, he had not had a shower lest it would bring his life to an end. On hearing this, the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) smiled and kept silent.” Reported by Abu Dawud.\nThis incident has a clear indication that' Arnr (may Allah be pleased with him) grasped the meaning of the verse as a reference to suicide and the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) did not deny this.\n{But whosoever does that, ~ refers to all prohibitions that the Surah states from its beginning according to the saying of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both). Other scholars, however, are of the opinion that the reference here is to the consumption of another's property with no right and unlawful murder.\n{In transgression and wrongfully,} means that those who commit murder or suicide and rebel against the Laws of Allah.\n{Him we shall certainly roast in a Fire; and that for God is an easy matter.} Surely, Allah is the Omnipotent Who has Power to fulfill what He has promised or warned.\nOn the authority of Jundub Ibn 'Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"There was amongst those before you a man who had a wound. He was depressed that he took a knife and cut his hand. The blood did not cease to flow until he died. Allah the Almighty said, 'My servant has forestalled Me, and I have forbidden paradise for him. .” Reported by AI-Bukhari.\nAbu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (pbuh) said, \"Whoever purposely throws himself from a mountain and kills himself will be in the Hell-fire falling down into it and abiding therein perpetually forever; and whoever drinks poison and kills himself with it, he will carry his poison in his hand and drink it in the Hell-fire wherein he will abide forever, and whoever kills himself with an iron weapon, he will carry that weapon in his hand and stab himself with it in the Hell-fire wherein he will abide forever.” Reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim.\nThabit Ibn Al-Dahhak (may Allah be pleased with him) reported the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) to have said,\n\"He who killed himself with any thing in this world will be tormented with that very thing on the Day of Judgment. Both cursing the believer and charging him with disbelief is tantamount to killing him.” Reported by A1-Bukhari.\nIt is also stated in the Sahih that\n\"The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) told his Companions about a man, who was wounded during a battle with the Prophet but he was not patient and he killed himself with the tip of his sword. The Prophet (pbuh) said \"that this man will to be among the people of Hell.” Reported by A1-Bukhari and Muslim."

        "description": "Allah Most High states,\n{Then let us earnestly pray and invoke the curse of Allah on those who lie!}\n(Al-'Imran: 61)\n{Allah guides not one who transgresses and lies!} (Ghafir: 28)\n{Cursed be the conjecturers (the liars).} (Al-Dhariyat: 10)\nOn the authority of Ibn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him), \"the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"Adhere firmly to truthfulness for truthfulness surely leads to righteousness and righteousness leads to Paradise, and a man is recorded with Allah as a sincere one as long as he is truthful.\nHowever, lying leads to immorality and immorality leads to the Hell-Fire, and a man is recorded with Allah as a liar as long as he lies.” Reported by A1-Bukhari and Muslim.\nHe (pbuh) also said,\n\"Three are the signs of the hypocrite, even if he prays, fasts, and pretends to be a Muslim: When he talks, he lies; when he makes a promise he breaks it; and when he is given a trust, he betrays it”\n In another narration it is reported on the authority of ' Abdullah Ibn 'Vmar that the Prophet (pbuh) said, \"Four traits if found together in a person make him a hypocrite. Whoever has one of these, possesses one of the hypocritical characteristics until he renounces it: When he speaks, he lies; when he draws a contract, he breaches it, When he makes a promise, he breaks it; and he abuses his opponents in time of dispute.” Reported by AI-Bukhari and Muslim.\nAI-Bukhari reported in his Sahih the following hadith on the authority of Samarah Ibn Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him):\n\"The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) used to ask, \"Did anyone of you see a dream?\" So those whom Allah wished to tell would narrate dreams to him. One morning the Prophet (pbuh) said, \"Last night two persons came to me in a dream and woke me up and said to me, 'Proceed!' I set out with them... And we came to a man laying flat on his back and another man standing over his head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of man's mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back of the neck and similarly tear his nose from front to back and his eyes from front to back. Then he turned to the other side of the man's face and did just as he had done with the other side. He hardly completed this side when the other side returned to its normal state. Then he returned to repeat what he had done before. I said to my two companions, 'Glory be to Allah! Who are these two persons?'... They said, 'This man is the symbol of the person who goes out of his house in the morning and tells so many lies that it spreads all over the world. '\"\nAllah's Messenger (pbuh) also said,\n\"The believer may be naturally disposed to any shortcoming except treachery and lying.” Reported by AI-Bukhari. Other hadith states,\n\"Beware of suspicion for suspicion is the most untruthful of speech.” Reported by AI-Bukhari.\n\"There are Three types of people with whom Allah would neither speak to on the Day of Judgment, nor would He look towards them, nor would He purify them (from sins) and there would be a tormenting chastisement for them: The aged adulterer, the lying ruler and the destitute who is full of pride.” Reported by Muslim.\n\"Woe to the one who tells lies to make people laugh. Woe to him, woe to him.” Reported by Abu Dawud and AI- Tirmidhi.\nFalse oaths are more heinous than the normal lying. Allah says about the character of the hypocrites:\n{And they swear to falsehood knowingly.} (AI-Mujadilah: 14)\nFurthermore, the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"There are three people whom Allah will not speak to, look at, or exonerate on the Day of Judgment, and who will have a painful torment: he who withholds what he has of excessive water from a traveler in the desert, he who sells merchandise after Asr (Late Afternoon) swearing by Allah that he paid more for it than he actually did, and a man gives the pledge to a governor only for the sake of this world,' he will only be loyal if he gets something of this worldly life.” Reported by A1-Bukhari and Muslim.\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"!t is a grievous treachery to tell your brother lies when he believes what you say.” Reported by Abu Dawud.\nA Hadith states,\n\"Whoever claimed to have seen a vision while he is lying, on the Day of Judgment he will be commanded to tide two hairs which is impossible.” Reported by AI-Bukhari and Muslim.\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n \"The worst sin in the sight of Allah is the false witness.” Reported by AI-Bukhari and Ahmad\nIbn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said, \"A servant insists on lying until a black dot be stamped over his heart and so his heart would be stamped as a whole with black color. With Allah such servant would be recorded as a liar.” Reported by Malik in AI-Muwata'.\nThe Muslim, therefore, is required to utter only the good words to be safe from error. Al-Bukhari reported on the authority of Abu Huriarah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"Whoever believes in Allah and in the Last Day should utter only good word or he should keep silent.\"\nThis agreed upon hadith indicates clearly that a person should not speak except with what seems to him as good.\nAbu Musa (may Allah be pleased with him) said that, \"I asked the Messenger of Allah, '0 Messenger of Allah! Who amongst Muslims is the most charitable?' He (pbuh) responded,\n\"The one who from his tongue and hands Muslims are safe.” Reported by A1-Bukhari and Muslim.\nIt is reported in the two Sahihs that,\n\"A servant may utter a word while he is unaware of its consequences, by it he would be thrown in Hell for a distance more far than the distance between the east and west.”\nBilal Ibn Al-Harith Al-Muzani said the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) declared,\n\"A man may speak a word out of Allah's Pleasure while he is unaware of its fruits, by which Allah decree pleasure for that man until he meets Him. On the other hand, a man may speak a word out of Allah's wrath while he is unaware of its consequences, by which Allah decree for him displeasure until he meets Him. \"\nOnce a righteous man was questioned about the number of Man's faults. Thereupon, he answered,\n\"Man's faults are innumerable but I know 8000 faults. However, man can conceal these numerous faults through keeping silent with the exception of good speak."

The judge who will go to Paradise is one who understands the truth and judges accordingly. One who judges unjustly after understanding the truth will go to Hell.\nLikewise, the judge who judges in ignorance also will go to Hell. The Companions then asked, “What is the guilt of the ignorant one?” He (pbuh) replied,\n\"Accepting the position of judge is his guilt until he gets a profound knowledge.” Reported by Al-Tirmidhi. On the authority of Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"Whoever is appointed to be a judge as if he is slaughtered without a knife.” Reported by Al- Tirmidhi.\nAI-Fudail Ibn 'Eyad (may Allah bestow mercy on him) said, 'the judge should spend a day in his job and a day in weeping over his own self.\"\nMuhammad Ibn Wasi' (may Allah best our mercy on him) said, \"On the Day of Judgment, the first of men who will be called to account are the judges.”\n'Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah say, \"On the Day of Judgment, the just judge would face a great trial that he wishes if he were not appointed to judge between people even in the division of a palm-date.” Reported by Ahmad.\n`Ali Ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) say, 'On the Day of Judgment, no ruler or judge but be brought before Allah, Exalted and Dignified be He, over the Sirat, then his deeds will be made public. If he was a just, Allah will save him. On the other hand, if he was unjust, the Sirat will strongly tremble to the extent that this one's organs would be scattered,' the distance between each organ would be such and such long and he will fall into Hell-Fire. \"\nMakhul, moreover, said, \"If I were to choose between holding the position of a judge and beheading, I would surely prefer beheading over holding this job.\"\nAyub Al-Sikhtiani further said, \"The more knowledge the scholar get, the more their fear of holding the position of a judge increases.\"\nHaving told that Shuraih was appointed to be a judge, AI- Thawri commented, \"They would corrupt the man.\"\nIt was narrated that Malik Ibn Al-Mundhir appointed Muhammad Ibn Wasi', to be the judge of Basra.\nWhen Muhammad objected, Malik warned him that he would flog him if he insisted on his objection. On hearing that Muhammad disclosed, \"If you do, you will be a tyrannical ruler. However, I prefer humiliation in this world over the torment in the world to come.\"\nWahb Ibn Manabah said, \"The more just the ruler is, the more blessing on his people Allah will descend.\"\nA worker wrote to `Umar Ibn `Abd AI-`Aziz, \"O 'Umar! The city of Hims has been destroyed and therefore it is in need of rebuilding.\" `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) replied, \"Fortify it with justice and clean its roads from oppression.\"\nHowever, the scholars of Islam state that the judge should not utter a judgment when he is angry, anxious or nervous. Furthermore, if a man of ignorance or immorality is appointed to be a judge, he should resign and leave the office."

        "description": "Allah Most High says,\n{And do not eat up your property among yourselves for vanities, nor use it as a bait for the judges, with intent that ye may eat up wrongfully and knowingly a little of (other) people's property.}\n(Al-Baqarah: 188)\nMuslims are prohibited to bribe a judge or a public officer to unfairly obtain a decision in favor of one's self against a rival or to unlawfully consume the property of others while they are aware of the prohibition of this act.\nOn the authority of Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"Allah's curse is on the one who offers the bribe and on the judge who accepts it.” Reported by At -Tirlllidhi.\nOn the authority of 'Abdullah Ibn 'Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) that,\n\"The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) cursed the one who offers the bribe and the one who receives it.” Reported by At- Tirlllidhi.\nHowever, the Muslim scholars affirm that bribery is prohibited when it is aimed at consuming other's property or rights unfairly. Thus, if someone finds himself in a situation in which all avenues of redressing a wrong done him, or recovering a right which has been forfeited, are blocked except through the payment of a bribe, the sin of it will not be on him but on the recipient of the bribe.\nAnother narration of the hadith explains that\n\"The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) cursed also the one who arranges for the payment of a bribe. \"\nFurthermore, what is mentioned above concerning the ruling of the one who offers a bribe applies to the one who arranges it, i.e., if it is aimed at obtaining fair ends, he would be sinless; and vice versa. Gifts to officials are a form of bribery. Abu Umamah AI-Bahli (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"Whoever intercedes on behalf of his brother and therefore he offers him a gift, it would be nothing other than a grievous usury.” Reported by Abu Dawud.\nIbn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said, \"To accept a gift from your brother because of fulfilling his need is the precise meaning of consuming the forbidden things.\"\nOnce Masruq asked Ibn Zyad to assist him in removing a wrong inflicted upon him. Having assisted him, Masruq offered Ibn Zyad a slave as a gift. Zyad, on his part, rejected the gift saying, \"I have heard Ibn Mas'ud say, 'Forbidden is the gift offered because of removing a wrong from a Muslim.) \"He wondered, \"O Abu' Abd AI-Rahman! Is not bribery restricted to offering a bribe to judges!\" He replied, \"This latter is a form of Shirk (association).” Mentioned by A1-Haithami in in Magama' Al-Zawa'd.\nOnce, a Christian man came to Imam Abi 'Amr AI-Awza'i (may Allah bestow mercy on him), who was living in Beirut, complaining of the ruler of Ba'labak and asking him to send to the ruler ordering him to stop from doing wrong to the Christian man. However, the Christian man brought with him a bottle of honey as a gift to Abi 'Amr. \nTherefore, Abi 'Amr commented, \"If you wish I would refuse your gift and send to the ruler of Ba'labak ordering him to stop from oppressing you; and if you wish I would accept your gift. Imam' Abi 'Amr send to the ruler of Ba'labak to reduce the amount of Kharaj (land-tax) from the Christian. Consequently, the Christian took the letter and his bottle of honey and traveled to the ruler of Ba'labak. Having read the letter of Abi ' Amr, the ruler reduced 30 Dirhams from Kharaj of the Christian man."

He (pbuh) also said,\n\"May Allah curse the effeminate man and the masculine woman.” Reported by A1-Bukhari.\nOn the authority of Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"Allah curses a woman who wears a men's clothing and a man who wears a woman's dress.” Reported by Abu Dawud.\nWhen woman wears a man's clothing, she will incur Allah's curse upon herself and her husband as long as he does not rebuke her or try to discipline her character. The husband, in Islam, is responsible about disciplining and teaching his wife as the Glorious Qur'an commands,\n{O ye who believe! Save yourselves and your families from a fire whose fuel is men and stones.]\n(AI- Tahrim: 6)\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) stressed this fact saying,\n\"Each of you is a guardian and responsible about his subjects: The man is a guardian over his household and will be asked about them on the Day of Judgment.” Reported by AI-Bukhari. He (pbuh) said further,\n\"Men would be perished because they obeyed women (in vanity).” Reported by Ahmad.\nAbu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"!t will not be a witness for two types of people who are destined for the Hell-fire: People with whips like the tails of cows, who beat the people (i.e., tyrannical rulers who are the enemies of their own people), and women who although clothed, are yet naked, seducing and being seduced, their hair styled like the tilted humps of camels. These will not enter the Garden nor its fragrance even reach them, although its fragrance reaches a very great distance.” Reported by Muslim.\nThe hadith depicts these women with clothed and naked ones meaning that although they are clothed by Allah's gifts, they are naked because of their ingratitude. Other scholars hold that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) described such women as being clothed, yet naked, since they wear clothes which fail to cover the body and which are transparent, revealing what is underneath.\nSuch women are further described as seducing and being seduced, meaning that they behave and walk in seductive and sensuous manner. They disobey Allah and call others to do so.\nThe Messenger (pbuh) likened their hairstyle to the humps, special breed of camel which has very large humps, because they put up their hair in a beehive shape from the middle of their heads.\nNafi' said, \" Once Ibn `Umar and 'Abdullah Ibn `Arnr were sitting with Al-Zubair Ibn `Abdul-Muttalib when a woman driving a flock of sheep and shouldering an arrow came to them. 'Abdullah Ibn `Umar asked, \"Are you man or woman?\" She said, \"A woman.\" Thereupon 'Abdullah said to his companions,\n\"Surely, Allah curse the women who imitate men and men who imitate women.” Reported by AI-Bukhari.\nThus, the display of women's attractions is a cause for incurring Allah's curse. This display may take various forms like exposing the ornament such as gold and pearls from under the head-covering, wearing revealing and sexy clothes, using of fragrant perfumes, etc. unfortunately, most of women today are accustomed to these immoral fashions.\nBy the same token, the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) stated,\n\"I looked at Hell-fire and saw the majority of its inhabitants are Women. \"He (pbuh) disclosed further, \"I left no harmful trial to men than women.” Reported by Muslim."

It is reported also by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad and An-Nasa'i in his Sunan with sahih transmission.\nIbn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) was asked about the ruling of the one who marries solely to permit the first husband to return to his divorced wife, whereupon he said,\n\"No (it is not a legal marriage), the legal marriage should be founded on wish and desire. No marriage is permitted which is based on deception or contradiction to Allah's Book. Satisfaction of sexual desires is a condition for legal marriage.” Reported by Ibn Majah.\n'Uqbah Ibn 'Amr said that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) once asked, \"Would I tell you about the hired billy goat?\" \"Yes: O Messenger of Allah!\" the people said. He (pbuh) explained, \"It is the one who marries solely to permit the first husband to return to his divorced wife. Verily, Allah Most High cursed this one and the former husband as well.” Mentioned by Ibn Hagar in Majma' Al-Zawaid and reported by Ibn Majah.\nOnce a man said to Ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) \"I have married a woman with the intention of permitting her first husband to remarry her. However, I have done so without the knowledge of the previous husband and he did not command me to do this. Is there any wrong?\" Ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) replied, \"Oh, it is not legal. Permissible marriage should be based on complete desire, if you wish, you could hold her and if you wish you could divorce her. In the lifetime of the Prophet (pbuh), we used to consider the like of your marriage as illicit sexual relation.\"\nMoreover, there are many narrations and reports that condemn the act of marring a woman solely to return to her first husband. The following are some of these narrations:\nAI-Thram and Ibn AI-Mundhir narrated that 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said, \"I would stone to' death the one who marries to permit the previous husband to return to his divorced wife. I would also stone to death the first husband.\"\n'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) was asked about marring a woman to permit her to return to the previous husband, whereupon he said, \"It is an illicit sexual relation.\"\n'Abdullah Ibn Sharauk AI-`Amri said, \"I heard Ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) when he was asked about a man who divorced his wife (his uncle's daughter) and someone else wanted to marry her to permit the former husband to remarry her. Ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) explained,\n'The former and latter are adulterers even if the marriage lasted for 20 years. However, the knowledge of the former husband by the aim of the marriage is the main criteria of incurring curse upon himself.\"\nA man asked Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), \"My uncle's son has divorced his wife and so he became regretful.\" Ibn `Abbas declared, \"Your uncle's son disobeyed Allah and, therefore, he was inflicted with regret, whereas he obeyed Satan who will not relieve him.\" The man asked more, \"What do you say in a man who wants to marry her to permit him to remarry her?\" He disclosed, 'He, thus, seeks to deceive Allah, but it is Allah who deceives him.\"\nIbrahim An-Nakh'i stated, \"If the first husband, the second husband, or the woman intends to marry solely to permit the first husband to remarry his divorced wife, the marriage will be illegal.\" Sa'id Ibn AI- Musaib said concerning this issue, \"It is prohibited in Islam.\"\nHowever, Malik Ibn Anas, Al-layth Ibn Su'd, Sufyan AI- Thawri, Imam Ahmad and other great scholars are of the same opinion.

The Jews said to Abu Lubabah, these families are living among the Jews, what do you say concerning the submission to the judgment of sai'd. Abu Lubabah then pointed at his throat meaning that Sa'd would sentence you to be slaughtered. Abu Lubabah said, \"I have not moved from my place until I realized that I betrayed Allah and His Messenger.”\n\"Nor misappropriate knowingly things entrusted to you\" means that Muslims are commanded to avoid betraying their trusts as they are prohibited to betray Allah and His Messenger (pbuh).

The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) declared further,\n\"Allah Most High says, 'I bless the partners as long as no one betrays the other.” Reported by Abu Dawud.\n\"Trust is the first of characteristics to disappear among people, where as prayer is the last one and the prayer of some persons may be of no avail.” Reported by Ibn Hajar Al-Haithami in Majma' Zawaid.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) cautioned the Ummah saying,\n\"Beware of treachery for it is the worst companion.” Reported by Abu Dawud.\nIbn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him) explained, \"On the Day of Judgment, the persons who betrayed their trust will be commanded to fulfill it. Consequently, they would wonder, 'How can we fulfill what had been perished in the worldly life!\" At this moment it would be pictured in the basest rank of Hellfire.\nHaving commanded to bring it from this place of Hell, the treacherous one would carry it over his shoulder and would find it heavier than the mountains of the world. As long as he reaches the top of the Hell, the trust would fall to the basest rank of Hell and it will happen forever\" Ibn Ma'ud added, \"Prayer is a trust, ablution is a trust, Body-worship is a trust, measuring is a trust and the' greatest form of trusts is the deposits.\""

Abu Umamah, however, is of the opinion that this verse was revealed concerning the so-called fatalism. The second view is that the bishop of Najran came to the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) and said, \"O Muhammed! you claim that sins are predetermined by Allah, but this is a wrong attitude.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) replied, \"You are the enemies of Allah.” Then the following verses were revealed {Truly those in sin are the ones in error and madness. The Day they will be dragged through the Fire on their faces, (they will hear.) taste ye the touch of Hell!’ Verily, all things have We created in proportion and measure.} (AI-Qamar: 47-49)\n'Umar Ibn al-Khattab said, \"The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"On the Day of Judgment, Allah will gather the first and the last of people and then order a caller to say with a clear voice, where are the enemies of Allah?\" The fatalists would stand whereupon they would be ordered to go to Hell.” Reported by Haithami. Allah says, {Taste ye the touch of Hell! Verily, all things have We created in proportion and measure. } \nThose men are called the enemies of Allah because they dispute how Allah predetermines sins and then punishes the sinners thereby.\"\nHisham Ibn Hassan commented, \"By Allah if a fatalist observes continuous fasting until he becomes as thin as thread, or observes continuous Prayer until he becomes as faint as string, Allah would order him to be dragged through the Fire on his face and then say to him {taste the touch of Hell! “Verily all things Have\nWe created in proportion and measure.}” ZaddAl-Muyasar, vol 8, p. 102\nIbn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) the Prophet said,\n\"Everything runs in accordance with Allah's Destiny even the inability and intelligence.” Reported by Muslim.\nIbn 'Abbas said, \"All things have We created in proportion and measure and they are recorded in AILawh\nAI-Mahfuz (The TabletPreserved).\"\nAllah Most High says,\n{But Allah has created you and your hadiwork! } (Al-saffat: 96)\nIbn Jarir, in his commentary on this verse, said, \"The verse is of two indications:\nFirst, it may mean that Allah has created you and what you make, i.e., idols.\"\nIn Surah Ash-Shams, Allah Most High says,\n{And its inspiration as to its wrong and its right.} (Ash-shams: 8)\nSa'id Ibn Jubair explained the meaning of this verse saying,\n{Allah implants in it the traits of good and the traits of evil.}\nA hadith states,\n\"Allah guides some people to the straight way and will grant them mercy.

He is the One and Only, the Eternal, the Creator Who does what He wills.\n\"Belief in the angels\" means to admit that they are devoted servants of Allah as the Glorious Qur'an illustrates,\n{They are (but) servants raised to honor. They speak not before He speaks, and they act (in all things) by His command.

        "description": "Here, the reference is to a person who passes on to others what he hears from someone in such a manner that will cause dissension among people. It is unanimously unlawful according to the opinions of the Muslim scholars. There are many proofs that maintain the prohibition of that abhorred action. The following are some of them:\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"He who stirs up enmity among people by quoting their words to each other will not enter paradise.” Reported by AI-Bukari and Muslim.\nOnce the Messengers of Allah (pbuh) passed by two graves and said,\n\"The two are being tormented, and not for anything excessive: one of them did not free himself of traces of urine, while the other was a talebearer.” Reported by AI-Bukari and Muslim.\nOn the authority of Abu Hurairh (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah said,\n\"You find that among the worst people is someone who is two-faced, showing one face to some and another face to the others.” Reported by AI-Bukari and Muslim.\nHe (pbuh) also said,\n\"Who he stirs up enmity among people by quoting their words in this world, Allah will severely torment him in the Hereafter;” Reported by Ibn Hibban and Abu Dawud. Imam Abu Hamid AI-Ghazali highlighted the fact that this heinous sin is not confined to transforming the speech of others only but it includes unveiling what one does not like to be unveiled even if it is done through speech, writing, gestures etc. One should, however, keep silent concerning what he discovers of the affairs of others except incase when publicizing it would benefit the Muslims or prevent them from committing a sin. Moreover, the one to whom talebearer told news of others, should abide by the following:\na) Disbelieving what this person told him for such a man is of no piety,\nb) Advising the talebearer to abstain from this heinous sin,\nc) Detesting the sinner for the sake of Allah,\nd) A voiding suspicion as the Glorious Qur'an instructs, {O ye who believe! A void suspicion as much (as possible): for suspicion in some cases is a sin.} (AI-Hurjurat: 12)\ne) Avoiding spying and searching out the other people's faults as the Glorious Qur'an commands, {And spy not on each other.} (AI-Hujurat: 12)\nf) Abhorring this sin: A man came to 'Umar Ibn 'Abd AI-'Aziz and told him something about another person which the latter would have disliked being mentioned. Thereupon 'Umar said to him, \"Let us examine your case: If you are lying, you are one of those who mentioned in the verse, ~If a sinner comes to you with any news, ascertain the truth. t (AI-Hujurat: 6), and if you are telling the truth, you are one of those mentioned in the verse, {A slanderer; going about with calumnies.} (Al-Qalam: 1) But if you wish we mayforgive you.\" The man replied, please forgive me, O Commander of the Believers. I shall never do it again.\nA man wrote a letter to As-Sahib Ibn 'Abad (may Allah bestow mercy on him) calling him to unlawfully consume a property of an orphan. When As-Sahib Ibn 'Abad, replied to his letter he said, \"Slander is abhorred, the dead is in Allah's mercy, the orphan is in Allah's support, the property is Allah's gift and the one who intercedes to consume unlawfully the property of others is cursed by Allah.\"\nAI-Hasan AI-Basri, said, \"Assuredly, the one who tells you about the speech of others would also tell others about your speech.\"\nReferring to the verse, {Violent (and cruel) with all that of a doubtful birth.} (AI-Qalam: 13), Ibn AIMubark said, the illegitimate child does not keep in secret the speech of people.\"\nOnce a righteous man visited one of his friends who told him something about another person that the latter would have disliked being mentioned. Thereupon, the righteous man said, 'O brother! You have committed backbiting and caused me to commit three crimes:\na) The abhorrence of that brother,\nb) Anxiety in my heart,\nc) Suspicion about your truthfulness.\nA man came to 'Ali Ibn AI-Husain (may Allah be pleased with him) saying, \"So and so of people insulted you.\" Thereupon, 'Ali Ibn AI-Husain said, \"Let's go to such man.\" Having reached the latter man, 'Ali Ibn AI-Husain said, \"If what you have said is true, I ask Allah then to forgive me. While if it is untrue, I ask Allah to forgive you.\"\nIn commenting on the verse, \"His wife shall carry the (crackling) wood as fuel.” (Al-Masad: 4), some scholars state that \"She was a talebearer. This heinous sin is likened with carrying the wood the similarity between carrying the news and carrying the wood is that in the former it causes fierce enmity while in the latter it causes fierce fire."

This, Ghazali notes, is because \"to curse means to distance another from the mercy of Allah Most High, while we do not know how the particular corrupt person or non-Muslim will end his life.\" As for those the Prophet (pbuh) personally cursed such as the tribes of Ri'la, Zakwan and 'Usiah, perhaps it was because he knew they would die in unbelief. Praying that evil befalls a person is similar to cursing, even when against a tyrant, such as saying, 'May Allah not heal him,' 'May Allah not keep him safe,' and similar remarks, all of which are blameworthy (being unlawful, if of a Muslim). And likewise for cursing any animals or inanimate objects whatever, all this is objectionable.\"\nThe scholars therefore say, \"Whoever curses someone who does not deserve so, let the former modify it by saying, if he deserves to be cursed.'\" It is permissible for one who invites to good and forbids evil to address someone saying, \"woe to you',\n\"O you who have wronged his own self\" and the like. Provided that he should avoid lying defamation, slander. Besides this, his objective should be admonishing and not insulting people."

These four characteristics of a hypocrite are: when he is entrusted (with something) he embezzles, when he talks he lies, when he promises he breaks it, and when he argues he starts abusing people.” \nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"For everyone who breaks his promise, there will be a flag (to mark him out) on the Day of Judgment, and it will be announced that this flag is the symbol of promise by so and so.” Reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"There will be three people against whom I shall fight on the Day of htdgment: one, the person who makes a promise with an oath in my name and then breaks it, two, the person who sells a free man as a slave and appropriates his sale proceed and three, the person who employs, a workman and having taken full work from him fails to pay him his dues.” Reported by Al-Bukhari, Ibn Majah and Ahmad.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Whoever withdraws himself from an engagement of loyalty will meet Allah with no excuse on the Day of Judgment. The death of someone who dies without the leader of a group over him is as if he had died in the pre-Islamic period of ignorance.” Reported by Muslim, Ibn Hibban and Ahmad."

She should not spend of his money, or do anything without permission. She also should not revile or disgust him.\nAl-Asma'i recounted, once I was passing by a desert and as met a very beautiful woman who had an ugly husband. I asked her, how did you accept him a husband? She said, give me your ear! He might have kept a good relation with Allah and thus He made me a reward to him. On the other hand, I might have disobeyed Allah and thus he made him my punishment.\n'Aishah said, \"O women, had you known your husbands' rights, any woman among you would have wiped dust from her husband's shoes on her face\"\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Your heavenly wife is the kind who, when her husband hurts comes close to her husband, puts her hand in his and says, I'll never sleep until you are pleased.” Reported by AI-Haithami in numerous ways all of which are weak.\n A woman should also be: loyal before her husband, lower her gaze before him, keep silent when he speaks, stand when he comes, or leaves, offer herself when he sleeps, perfume herself, brush her teeth (with Siwak), be adorned in his accompany, leave aside what annoys him in his presence like slandering or in absence like treachery in bed, property or home, honor his family and kinsmen, and be content of what he brings however little.\nA woman who fears Allah should do her best to obey Allah and her husband and seek his pleasures because he himself is her paradise or hell fire. The Prophet said,\n\"If a woman dies while her husband was pleased with her, she will enter paradise.”\n\"If a woman performs the five (prayers), fasts the month (of Ramadan) and obeys her husband, she will enter paradise from any gate she wants.” Reported by Ahmad.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Birds in the sky, whales in the water, angels in the heaven, the sun and the moon will all ask Allah to forgive women who obey their husbands so long as they are pleased with them. If a woman disobeys her husband she entails the curse of Allah, the angels and all people. If a woman makes her husband frown, Allah's wrath is upon her until she makes him laugh and pleased. If a woman leaves her husband's house without his permission, the angels curse her until she returns or repents.” \nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"There are four women in Paradise and they are: a chaste and an obedient one to Allah and her husband, patient, content, coy, and reproductive who guards her husband's property and herself in his absence and holds her tongue in his presence. A widow who devotes her life for her children and does not marry lest they fail. As for the four women of Hell –fire.” \"The woman who has a shrew tongue and is vulgar towards her husband, who does not guard herself in his absence and injures him with her tongue in his presences.\nThe one who charges her husband burdens greater than he can bear. The one who shows herself to men and goes out doors displaying her beauty. The one who does not concern herself except with food, drink and sleep. Further she is not eager to pray or to obey Allah and her husband, such a woman who in addition to that, leaves her husband's home without his permission is accursed by the people of fire until she repents to Allah.” Reported by A1-Bukhari.\nHe also said,\n\"Having had a look at the fire, I found that most of its people are women. This is because, they do not always obey Allah, his Messenger and their husband's and display their beauty to other than their husbands.” \n\"A woman is Awrah. Whenever she goes outdoors, Satan receives her.” Reported by At- Tirmidhi, Ibn Hibban and Abu Dawud.\nThe closer a woman is to Allah, the longer she stays in her home.\nThe Prophet said, \"A woman is privacy. Thus, hold her at home. Because, if she is about to go out door, and her kinsmen ask where are you going? She says, 'I'll visit a patient, or I'll attend a funeral. Satan keeps on tempting her until she leaves the house. Thus, if a woman seeks Allah's pleasure, it is better to her to stay home, worship Allah and obey her husband.” Reported by Ibn Hajar AI-Haith ami in Majma' Al-Zawa'id and he said that it is narrated by At- Tabarani and the transmitters of this hadith are trustworty.\nAli said to his wife, Patimah (may Allah be pleased with them both), \"O Patimah, what is the best thing for a woman? She answered, \"not to see men or be seem by them\". Ali also said, \"Do you not grow jealous! When you let your wives walk among men and see each other!\"\nOnce' Aishah and Hafsa were sitting with the Prophet (pbuh) when fun Umm Maktum who was blind came there.\n\"The Prophet (pbuh) said, \"Cover yourselves from him.\" They replied, \"We submit, O Messenger of Allah! Is he not blind and cannot see to recognize us. On this the Prophet (pbuh) said, But you are not blind and can see him.” Reported by Abu Dawud, At- Tirmidhi and Ahmad.\nThus, both men and women should not look at each other except because of necessity. Once there was a woman who used to display her beauty when she went outdoors. After her death, her kinsmen saw her in a dream standing before Allah dressed in transparent clothes. Then the wind blew and exposed her. Accordingly, Allah rejected her and said take her leftward to the Hell-Fire since she was displaying her beauty to the world.\nAli Ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) said,\n\"1 came to the Prophet accompanied with Fatimah but We noticed him weeping vehemently. I said,\n\"I sacrifice you with my father and mother, Messenger of Allah. Why do you weep?\" He said, \"0 Ali, in the night Journey (Isra) when I was taken up to the sky, I saw some women of my nation suffering some types of torture. Therefore, I wept because of their sever tortures. I saw a woman who was hanging from her hair and her brain was boiling. Another Woman was hanging from her tongue and a boiling fluid was being poured into her mouth. Another woman whose legs were tied to her breasts and her hands to her forehead and another who was hanging from her breasts. Another whose head was like a pig's and body like a donkey and suffered million types of torture, and another woman who had the shape of a dog while the fire pierced her month until it left her body from the anus and the angels were also Scourging her with lashes of fire. Upon hearing that, Fatimah asked. O darling and the pleasure of my eyes, what were they doing to Suffer such torture? Then the Prophet said; O daughter, as for the woman who was hanged from hair, she would not cover her hair from men. The woman who was hanged from her tongue used to bring harm to her husband; the one who was hanged from her breasts cumulated her husband's bed. The woman whose legs were tied to her breasts and hands to forehead and suffering from serpents and scorpions would not clean her body from major impurity or menstruation, and neglected prayer. The woman whose head was like a pig's and had a donkey’s body was a talebearer and lair. As for the last one, she used to remind recipients of her charity to them and was envious. O daughter, woe to her who disobeys her husband.” \nMuadh Ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) related that the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Whenever a woman causes annoyance and torture to her husband in this world, his mate from among the hour is of Paradise says to her: may Allah ruin thee, do not cause your husband annoyance, for, he is only your guest, and will soon leave thee to join us in Paradise.” Reported by At- Tirmidhi, Ibn Hibban, Ahmad and Ad-Dai1ami.\nSimilarly, a husband is commanded to treat his wife kindly and tenderly. He should also be patient if she mistreats him. Food, clothes and kind treatment are also binding for a man to give to his wife. Allah the Almighty says,\n{But consort with them in kindness} (An-Nisa': 19)\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"Listen! Treat women kindly, they are like prisoners in you hands. Beyond this do not use anything from them. If they are guilty of flagrant misbehaviors, you can remove them from your beds and beat them but do not inflict upon them any severe punishment. Then, if they obey you, you do not have recourse to anything else against them. Listen! You have your rights upon your wives and they have their rights upon you. Your right is that they shall not allow anyone you dislike to trample your bed and do not permit them to enter your home.” Reponed by At- Tirmdhi and Ibn Hibban.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"The best of you is whoever treats his wife kindly.” Reponed by At- Tirmidhi, Ibn Hibban and Ibn Majah.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) used to treat women very tenderly. He (pbuh) said,\n\"Whoever remains patient with regards to the misbehavior of his wife, Allah will give him a reward as great as Ayub's for his affliction. Likewise, if a woman keeps patient with regards to the misbehavior of her husband, Allah will give her a reward as great as 'Aishah's Bint Muzahim, (the Pharaoh's wife).” Reponed by AI-Hakim in AI-Mustadrak and he said that the Transmitters of this hadith are trustworthy.\nOnce, there was a man who came to 'Umar to complain about the misbehavior of his wife. While he was waiting for 'Umar by the door, he heard 'Umar's wife speaking to him indecently but 'Umar was keeping silent. Thereupon, the man went back and said, \"If this is the case of 'Umar who was decisive and he was also the Commander of the Believers what about me?\" Then 'Umar went out and noticed him leaving. He called him and said, \"What do you want?\" The man said, \"O Commander of the Believers, I came to complain about my wife's misconduct and her indecency towards me but when I heard your wife I went back and said what about me?\" 'Umar then said, \"O brother, I endured her misbehavior for some rights upon me to her: she cooked my food, bakes my bread, washes my clothes and suckles my babies.\nShe is not required to do such work. Furthermore, my heart is repelled from the unlawful because of her.\nThereby, I endured her. “So is my wife, Commander of the Believers\" the man said. Then, 'Umar said,\n\"Thus you should endure her. It is a short life we live in.\""

On the authority of Ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), \"The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"On the Day of Judgment, the picture-makers will be punished and will be told, \"Bring to life what you have created.” Reported by Al-Bukhari.\nOn the authority of 'Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said, \"Once the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) came back from a journey while I unintentionally covered myself with a curtain on which there were pictures of statutes. Upon seeing it, the face of the Messenger of Allah was changed and said,\n\"0 'Aishah, the most severely punished among people (on the Day of Judgment) will be those who try to create some thing similar to what Allah has created. 'Aishah (may Allah be pleased with he) said, 'I cut it off and made from it two cushions.” Reported by Al-Bukhari.\nOn the authority of Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said,\n\"I heard the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) saying, \"Every picture-maker will be in Hell-Fire, in which there will be, with every picture he has made (in the worldly life), a soul with which he will be tortured.” Reported by Muslim.\n Ibn ' Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) also reported that, \"I heard the messenger of Allah (pbuh) saying,\n\"In the worldly life, whoever made a picture, he would be ordered, on the Day of Judgment, to put life into it which he would never be able to do.” Reported by Al-Bukhari.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) has also been reported to have said,\n\"Allah the Almighty says, who does greater wrong than he who desires to create the like of what I create? Let them create a grain of barely! Let them create an atom.” Reported by Al-Bukhari.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"On the Day of Judgment, a neck (person) will come out from the Hell and will say, \"1 am entrusted with three persons, whoever associated with Allah other partners, every tyrant and oppressor and picture-maker.” Reported by At- Tifll1idhi.\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture.” Reported by A1-Bukhari. In Sunan Abu Dawud, it is reported on the authority of 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n\"The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog, a picture or a person who is in a state of ritual impurity.” Reported by Abu Dawud.\nConcerning this hadith, AI-Khattabi (may Allah bestow mercy upon him) said, \"What is meant by angels is those who descend with mercy and blessings and not those who are entrusted with recording the actions of the servants who accompany those who are in a state of ritual impurity or otherwise. It is also said that what is meant by \"a person who is in a state of ritual impurity\" is not the one who delays washing until the time of the Prayer comes but the one who does not wash himself from this impurity and neglects it to the extent that it becomes a habit for him. The following narration lends support to the previous meaning, \"The Prophet used to have sexual intercourse with all of his wives and wash himself only once.\"\nThis means that the Prophet (pbuh) delayed washing from ritual impurity and did not have body-washing directly after it became obligatory.\n'Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said, \"Sometimes the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings upon him) retired to his bed while he was in a state of ritual impurity and did not touch any water.” Reported by At- Tifll1idhi.\nAs for keeping dogs, it is prohibited if they are used in purposes other than guarding groups of people or for hunting. But if a person is obliged to keep them, for certain purposes, there will be no wrong in this.\nBy the same token, if the person keeps dogs for guarding his house, there will also be no wrong in this.\nAs for pictures, it includes everything, which has a soul, whether they are erected bodies, or painted in a ceiling or on a wall or placed in a certain pattern or woven in clothes or places. In all these cases, pictures should be avoided.\nPictures should be defaced and removed in cases where the person is able to do so. In his Sahih, Muslim reported on the authority of Hayyan Ibn Husain who said, \"Ali Ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) told me saying, \"Should I teach you something on which the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) has brought to me? Do not leave a picture until you erase it, or a raised grave unless leveling it.” Reported by Muslim."

It is also prohibited to dishevel one’s hair, slap the cheeks, scratch the face and to wail and burst into loud lamenting.\nUmm ‘Attiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her) said,\n“Among things upon which we gave the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) the oath of allegiance was to refrain from loud lamenting.” (Bukhari)\nAbu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessing be upon him) said,\n“Two qualities in people are unbelief attacking another’s ancestry, and wailing over the dead.” (Muslim)\nOn the authority of Abu Sa’id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) who said,\n“The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) has cursed the woman who loudly wails for the dead and whoever listens to her.” (Abu Dawood)\nOn the authority of Abu Burda who said,\n“Once Abu Musa Al-Ash’ari was sick and consequently he fell unconscious in the lap of a woman from his family. She, in turn, cried loudly and he could not stop her. When he became conscious, he said, “I cleared myself from what the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) cleared himself i.e., the woman who loudly laments, the one who shaves or plucks out her hair when being afflicted with an adversity and the one who rips her clothes.” (An Nisai)\nOn the authority of An-Nu’man Ibn Bashir (may Allah be pleased with him) who said,\n“Once’ Abdullah Ibn Rawaha fell unconscious. Consequently, his sister started wailing over him saying, ‘O so and so.’ When he became conscious, he said, ‘You never said something, unless it was said to me are you so and so.” (Bukhari)\nIt is also reported in the two Sahihs that, “The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n“In his grave, the dead is tortured with what he was lamenting over?” (Bukhari and Muslim)\nOn the authority of Abu Musa (may Allah be pleased with him) who said,\n“Never has a person died and his people wail upon him saying, ‘O our master, O our sustainer, or the so and so, and two angels not be entrusted with his torture saying, weren’t you so and so?”( Tirmidhi)\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n“If the woman who loudly laments the dead does not repent before the time of her death, she will be raised on the Day of Judgment wearing a garment from a tar and a coat of mail from scabies.”( Muslim)\nThe Prophet (pbuh) also said,\n“It is forbidden for me to make two foolish sounds, the one when being granted with a blessing; amusement, playing and the flute of Satan, and the other when being afflicted with an adversity; scratching one’s face, ripping one’s pockets and crying.” (Tirmidhi)\nAl-Hasan said, “Two sounds are cursed, the sound when being granted with a blessing and the sound when being afflicted with an adversity.” (Ibn Hajar Al-Haithami in Majma’ Al-Zawa’id)\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessing be upon him) also said,\n“The people who loudly wail will be made into two rows in the Hell-Fire and will bark at the people of the fire as dogs do.” (Ibn Hajar Al-Haithami in Majma’ Al-Zawa’id)\nAl-Awza’i said, once ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattab heard some people weeping, consequently, he entered upon them along with others and started beating them until he reached the woman who was wailing. He also beat her to such an extent that her veil (Hijab) fell down. He commented saying, ‘Beat her! She is wailing and there is no sanctity for such people. She does not weep out of being affected with your adversity, rather she sheds tears to take your money. This only harms your dead in their graves and the ones who are still alive in their homes. She also prohibits committing to patience which is the command of Allah and encourages despair which Allah forbids.”\nLoudly lamenting means to raise one’s voice with wailing and mentioning the good traits of the dead. It is also said that it means that to weep over the dead by mentioning his good traits.\nThe scholars said it is not allowed to raise your voice when weeping. As for weeping over the dead without wailing or loud lamenting, it is not forbidden. In Sahih of Al-Bukhari and Muslim, Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that, “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessing be upon him) visited Sa’d Ibn ‘Ubadah along with ‘Abdul-Rahman Ibn ‘Awf, Sa’d Ibn Abi Waqas and ‘Abdullah Ibn Mus’ud (may Allah be pleased with them all).\nThereupon the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) wept. Upon seeing the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) in this state, the people also wept. The Prophet said,\n“Don’t you hear?! Allah does not torment the people because of the tears of the eye or the grief of the heart. Rather, He torments or bestows His mercy upon the people because of the returns of “this” and he pointed to his tongue.” (Bukhari)\nIn the two Sahihs, it is also reported on the authority of Usarnah Ibn Zayd that “The son of the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) came to Messenger when he was dying. Thereupon, the eyes of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) were soaked with tears. Sa’d said, “O Messenger of Allah what is this?’ The Prophet said, “This is a mercy which is created by Allah within the hearts of His servants and Allah will only shower His mercy upon the merciful ones (amongst His servants)” (Bukhari)\nIn Sahih Al-Bukhari, it is reported on the authority of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that,\n“The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) entered upon his son, Ibrahim, while he was dying. Thereupon the eyes of the Prophet (pbuh) started to shed tears. ‘Abdul-Rahman Ibn ‘Awf said to him, ‘You too, O Messenger of Allah!’ The Prophet commented, ‘O Ibn Awf, it is a mercy’ and repeated it twice and said, ‘The eyes shed tears, the heart is grieved, but we do not say anything except what pleases Allah and for your death we are very sad, O Ibrahim.”( Bukhari)\nAs for the Sahih hadith which states,\n“The dead will be tortured with the weeping of his family over him.” (Bukhari)\nIt is not to be taken literally, it is interpreted differently by various scholars. The most evident meaning is, but Allah knows best, that the weeping may be for some other reasons such as the deceased person may have advised his family to do so prior to his death.\nThe followers of Shafi’i said, “The weeping over the dead is allowed before and after his death. But it is preferable for it to be done before the death according to the hadith which states, “Let them (weep), but when his soul is really taken, do not allow anyone (to weep).” Shafi’i and his followers stated that weeping after the death is only reprehensible but it is not forbidden. They interpreted the previous hadith as follows, “It is reprehensible to let them weep (after the death).”\nThe woman who loudly laments the dead will be tormented in such way because she, in so doing, orders the people to be despondent and impatient and this is in contradiction to what Allah and his Messenger has ordered. Allah the Almighty has said,\n{O ye who believe! Seek help with patient perseverance and prayer: for God is with those who patiently persevere and say not of those who are slain in the way of Allah: “They are dead” Nay, they are living, though ye perceive (it) not. Be sure We shall test you with something of fear and hunger, some loss in good, lives and the fruits (of your toil), but give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere, who say, when afflicted with calamity: To Allah we belong, and to Him is Our return.} (Al-Baqarah: 153-156)\n‘Ata’ reported Ibn’ Abbas to have said, “This means that Allah will support such people and will never disappoint them. Allah the Almighty said, {Be sure we shall test you.} i.e., Allah will treat such kind of people the same way He treated the afflicted people. That is because Allah knows the returns and consequences of all things and He is in no need for the afflicted to know the result but He just deals with them in such way.\nSo, whoever is patient, he will be rewarded for his patience and whoever is impatient, will be deprived of such reward then Allah said,{ with something of fear and hunger.} Ibn ‘Abbas said, {fear}means fear from the enemy and hunger means famine and drought.\nSome loss in goods p, means loss and decrease in property and death of animals. {Lives} means loss of lives through death, killing, disease and old age. {And the fruit} means decrease in needs of people and the fruits will be imperfect. Then Allah the Almighty ended the Ayah with giving good news to those who are patient to indicate that whoever was afflicted with these calamities and was patient, he is promised by Allah to be rewarded, Allah the Almighty said, “But give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere.” Then Allah described them saying, {who say when afflicted with calamity.} i.e., they were afflicted with what previously mentioned. To be afflicted with good thing is not affliction. { They say, to Allah we belong.} i.e., we are the servants of Allah and He can dispose with us with whatever He will. {And to Him is our return.} This will be through death. The return to Allah means that He will be the only Sovereign. That is because some people govern in this world, but as soon as they are deprived of it, they know the whole matter will be in the Hands of Allah, the Almighty.\nOn the authority of ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said, “The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n“Whatever the calamity a believer is afflicted with, he will be compensated for it, even the sting of the thorn.” (Bukhari)\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n“Whoever is afflicted with a calamity, let him remember the calamity of my death for it is the greatest of all.” (Darimi)\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n“The son of a person died and Allah the Almighty said to the angels, ‘Did you take the soul of the son of my servant.’They will reply, ‘Yes.’ Allah will say, ‘Did you take the fruit of his heart.’ They will reply, ‘yes.’ Allah will say, ‘What did my servant say.’ They will say, ‘He praised You and sought the reward from You.’ Allah will say ‘Build a house for my servant in Paradise and call it the house of praise.” (Tirmidhi)\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) also said,\n“The Almighty Allah said in a hadith Qudsi, “The reward of my believing servant, if I take the soul of his bosom friend in this world and he was patient and sought the reward from Me, will be nothing except Paradise.” (Bukhari)\nThe Prophet (pbuh) also said,\n“Among those things which bring happiness to the son of Adam is to be satisfied with what Allah has destined for him,’ and among things which bring him wretchedness is to be dissatisfied with Allah’s blessing.” (Tirmidhi)\nOn the authority of ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattab who said, “When the angel of death (peace be upon him) takes the soul of the believers, he will stand at the door of his house. There will be among his family the one who slaps her face, the one who dispersed her hair and the one who wails and bursts in loud lamenting. Thereupon the angel of death will say, “For what you display your anxiety and fear? By Allah, I did not decrease the span of life of anyone of you, nor decrease the provision of anyone of you, nor did I oppress anyone of you. So, if you complain and anxiety was upon me be sure that, I only was ordered to do so. And if they were upon your dead, by Allah he has nothing to do but to surrender. And if they were upon your Lord, by Allah you disbelieved in him. Surely I will return to you many times until I took you all.\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) commented,\n“By whom in whose hands my soul is, if they saw his place and heard his words, they would be surprised and would weep upon themselves.”\nConsolation\nOn the authority of’ Abdullah Ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said, “The Prophet (pbuh) said,\n“Whoever offers the consolation to the afflicted person, he will be rewarded with the same.” (Tirmidhi)\nOn the authority of Abu Barzah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said, “The Prophet (pbuh) said to Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her),\n“Whoever offers consolation to the person who is bereaved of his/her child, he will be clothed with Burd (certain kind of garment) in Paradise.” (Tirmidhi)\nOn the authority of ‘Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn Al-As (may Allah be pleased with both of them) who said, “The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said to his daughter Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her),\n“For what reason did you go out from your house. O Fatimah?” she said, “I went to the people of this house and asked Allah to shower his mercy upon their dead and I offered them consolation.” (Abu Dawud)\nOn the authority of Amr Ibn Hizam who said, “The Prophet (pbuh) said,\n“Never does a believer offer his afflicted brother consolation and Allah cloth him out of his Honour on the Day of Judgment.”( Ibn Majah)\nConsolation means that to bring patience and mention to the deceased’s kin what can relieve their sadness and lighten their calamity. It is recommended that it includes commanding the good and forbidding the evil. It also comes under the saying of Allah,\n{Help ye one another in righteousness and piety but help ye not one another in sin and rancor! } (Al-Maidah, 2)\nThis is the most indicative verse concerning the matter of consolation.\nConsolation is preferable before and after burying the dead. The followers of Ash-Shafi’i said, its time starts from the time when the soul is taken and lasts for three days after burying the dead. Some scholars said, consolation is not preferable after three days of dying, for consolation appeases the heart of the afflicted person and this mostly takes place within three days and therefore there is no need to renew his sadness. This same position was held by the majority of the scholars. Abu Al-Abbass said, there is no wrong to offer consolation after three days since the event lasts forever. An-Nawawi (may Allah bestow mercy upon him) said, “What is agreed upon is that it should not be offered after three days except in two cases: when the one who offers the consolation is absent or the afflicted person was absent as well. And they are expected to return after three days. Offering consolation after burying the dead is better than doing it before burying, for before burying, the people of the dead are engaged with preparing him and alienation is intensified after burying. This may be done if no anxiety appeared on the part of the people of the dead.\nOtherwise, consolation should be offered to bring quietness to them. It is also reprehensible to gather in a particular place to receive the consolation. This means that the people of the dead should not gather in a certain place and the people go to offer them consolation. The formula of consolation is well known. The best of what can be said in this respect is what is reported in the two Sahihs on the authority of Usamah Ibn Zayed (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that, “One of the daughters of the Prophet (pbuh) sent to him and told him that one of her children is dying. The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said to the man, “Return to her and tell her that, to Allah is what He has taken and to him is what He has given and to everything is an appointed term with Allah. So, order her to be patient and seek the reward from Allah.” (Reported before)\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah bestow mercy upon him) said that, “This hadith is one of the most comprehensive rules of Islam which includes many religious matters, whether they are principles, subsidiary matters, good manners, patience towards all kinds of calamities, worries and discusses many other things.\n“To Allah is what He has taken.” means that the whole world is His. Therefore, He does not take what is yours but what is His as a trust to you.” To him is what he has given” means that what he has granted you with is not out of His Sovereignty but it is His and He disposes it as He wills. “To everything there is an appointed term with Allah” means that you should not be anxious for the one whose soul was taken by him, completed his span in this life and it is impossible to delay or precede his appointed time. Upon being sure of all this, you should be patient with what has afflicted you.\nOn the authority of Mu’awiyyah Ibn Iyas from his father (may Allah be pleased with him) who said once the Prophet (pbuh) did not see one of his Companions and he asked about him. The Companions replied,\n“O Messenger of Allah, his son who you have seen has died. Thereafter, the Prophet (pbuh) met him and asked him about his son and he told him that he died. The Prophet consoled him then said, “Which of them is most beloved to you, to enjoy this worldly life with your son or to come tomorrow and find that your son preceded you to open whichever of the doors of Paradise you want. The man replied, “O the Prophet of Allah, of course to advance me to Paradise and find it open for me is most beloved. The Prophet said, this is granted to you. The companions asked, “is it exclusive for him or is it general for all Muslims? The Prophet replied, “For all Muslims.” (An-Nasa’i)\nOn the authority of Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said,\n“The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) went out to Al-Baqr and he saw a woman wailing on a grave. He said to her, “O the servant of Allah, fear Allah and be patient”. She replied, “O the servant of Allah, if you were afflicted with what I have been, you would excuse me!” The Prophet said to her, “O servant of Allah, fear Allah and be patient.” She replied, “0 the servant of Allah, I heard what you said, so let me alone. Abu Hurairah said, “The Prophet let her alone and there was a man who witnessed this scene and came to this woman and asked her what did this man (the Prophet) say to her? She told him what he said and with what she replied him. The man asked her did you know him? She replied, “No, By Allah.” He said, “Woe to you! He is the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him). Thereupon, she quickly walked towards him until she reached him and said, “O Messenger of Allah, I will be patient”. The Prophet said, “Patience is at the time of the suddenness of the calamity.” (Bukhari)\nThis means that the patience is more virtuous at the suddenness of the calamity, but after that, solace, of course, takes place.\nIn Sahih Muslim, it is reported that,\n“Once one of Abu Talha’s sons died. His wife, Umm Salim said to his family, don’t tell Abu Talha and I will tell him myself upon returning of Abu Talha, she offered the dinner for him and he ate and drank. Then she made up herself more than she did for him before that and Abu Talha had sexual intercourse with her. Upon realizing that he satisfied himself from her, she said, O Abu Talha, what do you say about some people who lent something to others, then they demanded their right, do other people have the right to deny them this thing? He replied, “No”. Umm Salim said, “Deem your son as a trust which returned to Allah. Abu Talha got angry and said, do you leave me until I stain myself with you then you told me about my son. This, by Allah will never cause me to be patient. Then he went to the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) and told him about what had happened. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him said, “May Allah bless your night for you both.” (Bukhari)\nIn another narration, it is reported that,\n“With the best and all-embracing good, no one is granted something better than patience.” (Bukhari)\nAli Ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) said to Al-Ashas Ibn Qays, “Be committed to patience and count your dead as a trust which returned to Allah’s keeping, otherwise you are behaving the way the animals do.”\nA wise man wrote to an afflicted man saying, “You lost what you have been afflicted with, so do not let its compensation i.e., the reward, miss you also.” Another man said, “The sane person does on the first day of his calamity what the foolish person does on the fifth day of his calamity.”\nIt is well-known that the passing of time consoles and relieves the afflicted person. Therefore the lawgiver ordered the people to be patient on the suddenness of calamity. Once Ash-Shafi’i (may Allah be pleased with him) was told that Abdul-Rahman Ibn Mahdi lost one of his sons and he was very anxious and distressed because of his death. Thereupon, Ash-Shafi’i sent him a message saying, “O my brother console yourself with what you console others with and detest from yourself what you detest from other’s doings. Be sure that the most grievous calamity is the one which deprives the person the delight and the reward, so what do you say about the combination of these two thing and the doing of a sin? So hasten to your destiny while it is near to you before demanding it while it goes far from you. May Allah grant you patience at times of calamity and reward you and us for it.”\nA man wrote to some of his brothers to console him because of the death of his son saying” “As long as the son is living, he is a source of sadness and trial for his father, but when he dies he becomes a prayer and a mercy for his father. Therefore, don’t be sad for what you missed, you missed his sadness and trial and do not lose the prayer and mercy which Allah offers you.\nMusa Ibn Al-Mahhdi consoled Ibrahim Ibn Salamah on the death of his son saying, “Was not he a source of happiness although he was a calamity and a trial but when he died, he became a source of sadness then he became a prayer and mercy?\nA man consoled another saying, “the one who will be a reward for you in the hereafter is better than the one who was a source of your delight and happiness in the worldly life.” It is also reported that Abdullah Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) buried one of his sons and laughed at the grave. He was asked do you laugh while you are still standing at the grave? He replied, I was to overcome by Satan. Ibn Jarih (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “Whoever is not be patient at the time of calamity and deem his dead as a trust which is in Allah’s keeping, he will behave the way the animals do.”\nHamid Al-Araj said, “I saw Sa’id Ibn Jubair saying to his son and looking at him, I know a particular characteristic of you. He was asked what is it? He replied, “He will die and I will deem him as a trust which is returned to Allah’s keeping.\nAl-Hasan Al-Basri (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that,\n“A man was very sad because of the death of his son and he complained this to him. Al-Hasan said, “Was your son absent from you before his death? The man replied, “Yes, his absence was more than his attendance. Al-Hasan said,”So deem his absence forever but this time will be the most rewarding for you. The man said, O Abu Sa’id, You appeased my anxiety about my son.\nOnce ‘Umar Ibn ‘Abdul-’ Aziz entered upon his son while he was ill and said, “O my son, how are you?” He replied, “I found myself in the truth.” ‘Umar said, O my son, to be in my scale! It is more beloved for me to be in your scale (‘Umar mean that his sins are more than his son’s.” The son replied, “O my father, to be granted what you love is more beloved to me than to be granted what I love.”\nOnce, ‘Urwah was attacked by disease in his leg and he was obliged to cut it off and he cut it off himself despite he was an old man. He did not leave out his oft-frequently remembrance which he used to do on this night, but he recited Allah’s saying,\n{Bring as our early meal, truly we have suffered much fatigue at this (stage of) our journey} (Al-Kahf: 62)\nHe (may Allah be pleased with him) also said, “O Allah! If You afflicted me, you truly relieved me and if you took something, truly you saved me many others. You took one organ and saved for me many others and you took a son and saved me many others. On the same night a man from Banu Abs entered upon Al- Walid Ibn Abd ul-Malik. Al-Walid asked him about his eye. The man said, “I spent one night in the peak of a valley and I didn’t know anyone from Bany Abd who may be more rich than me. Then we were afflicted with a torrent. Consequently, all my property, family and children were destroyed with exception of a camel and a son. The camel was very reluctant and it ran away and I started to follow it. I did not leave my son except for a short distance and I heard his crying. I returned to him and I found his head under its belly and it killed him. Then I followed the camel to catch it, but it kicked me with its foot and it disfigured my face and blinded my eye. Then I became deprived of my family, my property, my son and my camel.”\nThereupon, Al-Walid said, “Take this man and bring him before ‘Urwah so he knows that there are many others who are more afflicted than him.”\nIt is also reported that, when ‘Uhman (may Allah be pleased with him) was attacked and beaten, he said while blood was flowing upon his beard, “There is no God but Allah, Glory be to you. Truly I was one of those who wronged themselves. O Allah! I seek Your help against them and I seek Your help in all my affairs. O Allah! I ask You to grant me patience on what You afflicted me with.\nAl-Mada’ni said, “I saw in the desert a very beautiful woman and I said, “By Allah, this woman is surely a very prosperous and rich. She said, “By Allah, this is not true, I suffered many distresses and worries and I will tell you my story. I was married to a man and we had two children. On the day of ‘Eid ul- Adha (Feast of Sacrifice), their father slaughtered a sheep and they were playing. The elder son said to his younger brother, do you want me to show you how my father slaughtered the sheep? The younger son said, ‘Yes’. Then the elder son slaughtered his brother and when he saw his brother bleeding he was very scared and ran away towards the mountain and a wolf devoured him. His father followed him to bring him back, but he lost his way in the desert and he died from hunger and I became lonely. Al-Mada’ni asked her, “How are you with patience?” She said, “If it accompanies me, I will abide by it, but it was a wound and I recovered.”\nOn the authority of Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said,\n“I heard the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) saying, “Whoever has two sons and they died in his lifetime, he will enter Paradise. Aishah asked, “May my father and mother be a compensation for you! What about the one who has one son?” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessing be upon him) said, “He will have the same reward” ‘Aishah proceeded, “What about the one who has none of your Ummah?’ He said, “I am the forerunner of my Ummah and they were not afflicted with a more grievous calamity than mine (death).” (Tirmidhi)\nOne the authority of Abu Ubaidah (may Allah be pleased with him) from his father who said, “The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n“Whoever has three sons and they died in his lifetime before attaining the age of puberty, they will be a protection for him from the Hell-Fire.” Abu AI-Darda, and in another narration Abu Dharr, said, “I introduced two sons. The Prophet said, “They will bring you the same reward. Ubai Ibn Ka’b, the muster of the readers of the Glorious Qur’an said, “I introduced one. ” The Prophet (pbuh) said, “He will bring you the same reward, but this is at the time of the suddenness of the calamity.” (Tirmidhi)\nOn the authority of Waki’ who said,”There was a son for Ibrahim AI-Harbi and he was eleven years when he memorized the Glorious Qur’an and was knowledgeable in Fiqh and Hadith. He died and I went to console his father. He said to me,” I was longing for his death.” I said, O Abu Ishaq, how could you say something like that while you enjoy such a status among the scholars? Your son was grown up, memorized the Qur’an and was knowledgeable in Fiqh and Hadith. He said, I saw in a dream as if we it was the Day of Judgment and there were many children who are carrying cups of water and met the people to give them water. The Day was very hot and I said to one of them, give me some water. He looked at me and said you are my father. I said who are you? He said, we are the children who died in the religion of Islam and we foreran our fathers to give them the water to drink. For this reason I hoped for his death.”\nMuslim reported on the authority of Abu Hasan who said that, “I said to Abu Hurairah talk with us about something that may relieve us from our sadness concerning our dead.” He said, they are the boys of Paradise and they meet their fathers or their parents and catch their clothes or hands and don’t leave them until they enter Paradise.” (Muslim)\nMalik Ibn Dinar (may Allah be pleased with him) said, ” At the beginning of my life I indulged in every type of amusement and wine drinking. I bought a slave girl and I had a sexual intercourse with her and she gave birth to a girl. I loved the girl in the true sense of the word. She grew up and started to walk. Whenever I wanted to drink she came and poured it before my hands. When she was two years old she died and I was very distressed and sad because of her death. Then when it was the fourteenth night of Sha’ban I slept and I was very intoxicated. I saw in my dream as if we are on the Day of Judgment and I was raised from my grave. Then there was a dragon following me and wanted to eat me. I fled from it but it did not leave me alone. The more I ran fast, the more it hurried and I was very fearful. On my way I passed by an old man with a clean and pure clothes and feeble body. I said, I entreat you to protect me from this tannin which want to eat and destroy me. He said to me, O my son I an a very old man and I am not able to face this tannin. But pass and hurry and may Allah protect you against it. I ran away and it followed me. I was very near to the layers of the fire while they were boiling and I was about to fall into them. I heard someone saying; rescue this wretched person before his enemy reaches him. Thereupon the gates were open and curtains were pulled up and there were children, with faces like the moon, looking at me. My daughter was amongst them and when she saw me she went down to a scale of light and beat it with her its right hand and consequently the tannin ran away. She sat in my lap and said, O my father, {has not the time arrived for the believers that their hearts in all humility should engage in the remembrance of Allah and of the truth which has been revealed ( to them)} (Al-Haddid: 16)\nI said to her, “O my daughter do you know the Glorious Qur’an? She replied, “We know it more than you, I said, “O my daughter, what do you do here? We are the Muslim children who died and were placed here until the Day of Judgment awaiting you.” I asked her, “O my daughter what is this dragon who wants to destroy me? She said, “O my father, this is your odious deeds you strengthened it until it wants to destroy you. I asked her who is this feeble man? She said, “This is your good deeds you weakened it until it was unable to face your odious deeds. So repent to Allah and be not among those who are destroyed.” Then I rose from my sleep and I repented to Allah from this time. Therefore, contemplate (may Allah have mercy towards you) the blessing of the death of children, whether male or female, while they are younger. Their parents will have the reward of them if they are patient and seek the compensation from Allah and say, praise be to Allah, to Allah we belong and to him is our return. They, in return, have what Allah has promised them, {Who say, when afflicted with calamity: to Allah we belong.} (Al-Baqarah: 156) i.e. we and our property is for Allah and He has the right to dispose with it as He wills. And to Him is our return.” this is an admission that everything will be destroyed and everything will return to Allah.\nOn the authority of Thawban (may Allah be pleased with him) who said, “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said,\n“Never is a person afflicted with calamity unless it is due to two things, either because of a sin which will not be forgiven except by this calamity or because of a certain status which he will never attain except through this calamity.” (Mundhiri_\nSa’id Ibn Jubair said,\n“This nation was given something at time of calamity which the Prophets preceding it were deprived of i.e., {To Allah we belong and to Him is our return.” He proceeded to say, “If the Prophets were granted with it, it would be given to Jacob (pbuh) who said, “How great is my grief for Yusuf} (Yusuf: 84)\nOn the authority of Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said, I heard the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) saying,\n“Never is a person afflicted with a calamity and say, “To Allah we belong and to him is our return. O Allah! Reward me in my calamity and compensate me with something better than it, and Allah not reward him and compensate him with something better than it.” Umm Salamah said, when Abu Salamah died, I said, who is better than Abu Salamah then I said it and Allah compensated me with the Messenger of Allah (pbuh).” (Muslim)\nOn the authority of Al-Shu’bi who said, Shuraih said, when I have been afflicted with a calamity. I thank Allah four times, I thank Him that He did not afflict me with something more grievous than it, I thank Him for granting me patience for it. I thank Him that he helped me to review what I hope of reward and I thank Him that he did not make it in my religion. Allah the Almighty said,\n{They are those on whom (descended) blessings from their Lord, and mercy, and they are the ones that receive guidance.} (Al-Baqarah: 157)\nHere blessings mean mercy and forgiveness. {They are the ones that receive guidance} means, they are the ones who are guided to review their works and deeds. It is also said that they are the ones who are guided to Paradise and rewards.\nOne the authority of Sa’id Ibn Al-Musayyab from ‘Umar Ibn Al Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) who said in his comment on, {They are the ones on whom (descended blessings from their Lord, and mercy}, how blessed they are. He said also, {they are the ones that receive guidance.} how blessed is this promotion. (Hakim)\nAs for the person who is afflicted with a calamity and he displayed his dissatisfaction through wailing and bursting in loud lamenting, slapping one’s cheeks, ripping one’s pockets, dishevelling, shaving, cutting off, or plucking out one’s hair. He will invoke Allah’s wrath and curse upon himself whether he is a man or a woman.\nIt is also reported that beating over one’s thighs at the time of calamity deprives the person the reward.\nIt is also reported that,\n“Whoever is afflicted with a calamity and he tears his clothes, slaps his face, rips his pockets or plucks out his hair, he resembles the one who takes his arrow and wants to fight Allah.”\nIt is previously mentioned that Allah does not torture the people because of the tears of the eyes or the grief of the heart. Rather He tortures them for the returns of their tongues and what they say at the time of affliction of loud lamenting and crying. It is also previously mentioned that the dead is tortured with what he was lamented with. So, if the woman laments and says O my sustainer, O my helper, or the one who clothes me, the person will be tortured and it will be said to him, are you her sustainer, are you her helper, are you the one who clothes her? Therefore, loud lamenting is not allowed for it enraged the grief and encourages impatience. It “also goes against the satisfaction with Allah’s destiny and submitting to Allah’s orders.\nSalih Al-Mari said, once one Thursday evening I was among the graves and sleep overcome me. I saw in my dream as if the graves were cracked and the dead were raised and sat in many sessions (circles) and upon them there were covered plates descended. There was amongst them a young man who was tormented with all types of torture. I went to him and asked, O young man, why are you tortured from amongst these people? He said to me, O Salih, I entreat you to transfer what I will say to you and pay the trust arid be merciful to rescue me from my grief, may Allah the Almighty make you the one who will bring me salvation. When I died and my mother gathered many women and lamented and wailed over me every day. I was tormented with their wailing and the fire surrounded me from all directions because of what they said. May Allah not reward her with any good because of me. Then he started weeping until I wept due to his state. He then said O Salih go to my mother, and he told me about her place, and say to her, why do you torment your son? She brought me up and protected me against misfortunes and when I died she threw me into the torture. O my mother, if you saw my state, the chains in my neck, the cuffs in my feet, and the angels of torture beating me, you will be merciful towards me. If you do not give up what you say of wailing and lamenting, Allah will judge between you and me on the Day of Judgment. Salih said, I woke up in fear and stayed in my place until the time of dawn. In the morning, I went to this village and I had no concern except to reach the house of the mother of this young man. I asked about her and I reached her. The door of her house was blackened and the sound of lamenting and wailing was heard from outside of the house. I knocked the door and there came an old woman and said what do you want? I said, I want the mother of the youth who died. She asked what do you want from her? She is engaged with her grief. I said to her summon her for I have a message for her from her son. She entered and told her. The mother came out wearing black clothes and her face was black out of oft wailing and weeping. She asked me who I was? I said, I am Salih Al Mari. Yesterday I was at the graves and so and so have happened to me with your son.\nI saw him tortured and saying, O my mother, you brought me up and protected me against misfortunes and when I died you threw me into the torture. If you do not give up what you say of wailing and lamenting, Allah will judge between you and me on the Day of Judgment. Upon hearing that, she fell unconscious.\nWhen she restored her state, she grievously wept and said O my son it is so cherished to me and if I knew, I would never do it and I repent to Allah from my doing. Then she entered her house, changed her clothes and gave me a suite filled with Dirhams and said, O Salih, give these Dirhams in charity on behalf of my son. Salih said goodbye to her, supplicated to Allah for her, went away and gave the dirhams in charity. On the night of the next Thursday, I went to the graves as I used to do and I slept. I saw in my dream that the people in the cemetery rose from their graves and sat in circles and upon them the plates were descended.\nThe young man was very happy and delightful amongst them and to him there came a plate and he took it. When he saw me, he advanced towards me and said, O Salih, may Allah reward you in the best way for me, Allah the Almighty relieved me from the torture because my mother gave up wailing and lamenting. The reward of charity also reached me. Sahih said, what are these plates? These are the presents of the living people to their dead, from charity, recitation of the Qur’an and supplication. They descended upon them every night of thus. It is said this is the present of so and so to you. So, return to my mother and send peace upon her and say to her may Allah reward you in the best way for me. I received the reward of your charity on behalf of me and you will join us soon, so prepare yourself. Salih said, “I awake and come to the house of the mother of this youth after some days. I found a bier at its door. I asked for whom this bier is placed?\nThey replied, for the mother of the youth. I offered prayer upon her and she was buried beside her son in this grave. I supplicated Allah for them and went away.\nWe ask Allah to cause us to die while we are Muslims and join us to the righteous people and protect us from the Fire, for He is Ever-Generous, Ever Relenting and Ever-Merciful"

Ibn ‘Abbas said that he designate for the adulteresses a sum of money to charge Moses (pbuh) with this heinous crime. Ad-Dahak said he transgressed by disbelief in Allah, the Almighty. Qatada said he transgressed through exalting himself. Ata’ Al- Khurasani said, he transgressed through making his clothes longer than the peoples by a span. And Al-Mawrdi said, he served under the Pharaoh and he transgressed and oppressed the children of Israel.\nConcerning Allah’s saying” {Then we caused the earth to swallow up him and his house} the scholars said,\n“When Qarun ordered the adulteresses to charge Moses as previously mentioned, Moses got angry and he supplicated Allah against him. Allah the Almighty revealed to him saying, “I ordered the earth to obey you so order it with whatever you want. Moses said, ‘O earth, swallow him,’ so it swallowed him until his bed was sunk into the earth. When Qarun saw this he entreated Moses by the kinship. But Moses said, ‘O earth, swallow him and it took him until his feet were sunk.’ Moses continued to supplicate until Qarun was completely swallowed by the earth. There upon Allah revealed to him, “O Moses how harsh you are. By my honor and Glory, if he entreated me, I would respond to him! Ibn ‘Abbas said, Allah caused the earth to swallow him up until he reached to the lowest earth.\nSamrah Ibn Jundub said, whenever the earth swallowed him he would return back to normal and the process would be repeated. Muqatif said, “When Qarun was destroyed, Banu Israel said, “It is Moses who destroyed him to take his property and his house, so Allah caused the earth to swallow him up after three days; {And he had not (the least little) party to help him against Allah)} i.e., to protect him from Allah, {Nor could he defend himself} i.e. he could not prevent what Allah has revealed him of chastisement."

        "description": "This includes overbearing the weak, the male slave, the female slave, the wife and the beast. Allah, the Almighty ordered us to deal in kindness towards these varieties. He said,\n{Serve Allah and join not any partners with Him, and do good to parents, kinsfolk, orphans, those in need, neighbors who are of kin, neighbors who are strangers, the companion by your side, the way-fairer( ye meet) and what your right hands possess: for Allah loveth not the arrogant, the vainglorious} (An-Nisa’: 36)\nConcerning Allah’s saying,\n{Serve Allah, and join not any partners with Him}\nAl-Wahidi said “Ahmad Ibn Ibrahim Al-Mahragjani told us on the authority of Mu’adh Ibn Jabal (may Allah be please with him) who said, once I was riding behind the Prophet (pbuh) on a donkey. The Prophet said, O Mu’adh, I said, here I am! At your service O Messenger of Allah. He said,\n“Do you know what are the rights of Allah towards His servants and what are the rights of the servants towards their Lord? I said, “Allah and His Messenger know best. He said, “The rights of Allah towards His servants is to worship Him and ascribe not any partners unto Him and the right of servants towards their Lord is to torment not the one who does not ascribe any partner unto Him.” (Bukhari) \nOn the authority of Ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) who said, “Once a bedouin came to the Prophet (pbuh) and said, O the Prophet of Allah, counsel me? The Prophet said,\n“Do not ascribe anything unto Allah, even if you are cut up into pieces or burnt and do not delay the prayer from its appointed times for it is the trust of Allah. And do not drink wine for it is the key of every evil.” (Ibn Majah)\nAllah, the Almighty said, {and do good to parents} this means that the person should deal gently and be kind to his parents. He should not be harsh in his response to them. He should be before them as the slave before his master. {Kinsfolk} Allah means that the person should have good relations with them and be kind towards them. {Orphans} the person should be merciful towards them and rub their heads. Those in need, By spending some of his money and returning gratitude. Neighbors who are of kin, means those with whom you have a kinship. They have the right of kinship, the right of a neighborhood and the right of Islam. Neighbors who are “strangers” are those with whom you have no kinship.\nOn the authority of ‘ Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) “The Prophet (pbuh) said,\n“Gabriel continued to counsel me concerning the neighbor until I thought that he would designate to him a share of inheritance.” (Bukhari)\nOn the authority of Anas Ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him), “The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n“On the Day of Judgment, the neighbor will hang himself to his neighbor saying, “O Lord, you granted my brother many blessings and deprived me any. I spent my night suffering the hunger while he was very satisfied. Ask him why he was very stingy and prevented me any of the blessings You granted to him.” (Al-Asbahani in At-Targhib wa At-Tarhib)\nConcerning Allah’s saying, {The companion be our side} Ibn ‘Abbas and Mujahid said, he is the one who accompanies you in travel, he has the right of the neighbor and the right of companionship. (The wayfarer is the weak and you should guide him to what he wants. Ibn ‘Abbas said a person should receive the wayfarer with hospitality and should feed him until he goes away.” What your right hands possess, they are the slaves, whether male or female. The person should provide for him and should forgive him his mistakes. Concerning Allah’s saying, {for Allah loveth not the arrogant, the vainglorious}, Ibn ‘Abbas said, “What is meant by arrogant is the one who exalted in himself (very proud) who does not observe Allah’s rights. By the vainglorious, Allah means, the one who exalts himself over people by the blessings which Allah has granted him.\nOn the authority of Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said, “The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n“While a man, from those who preceded you, wearing a garment was walking arrogantly and in a vainglorious way, he was swallowed by the earth and he will be driven in it until the Day of Judgment.”\nUsamah said I heard Ibn ‘Umar saying, “I heard the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) saying,\n“Whoever drags his clothes out of conceit, Allah will not look at him on the Day of Judgment.” (Bukhari)\nIn this death disease, the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) used to advise people with prayer and with what their right hands possess saying,\n“Allah, Allah, be heedful of prayer and what your right hands possess.” (Abu Dawud)\nIn another narration, it is reported that,\n“Good treatment of what the person owns is a good omen and ill-treatment is a bad omen.” (Abu Dawud)\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n“The one who treat what he owns in an evil way will never enter Paradise.” (Ibn Majah)\nIbn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said,\n“Once I was beating my slave with a whip and I heard a voice from behind me saying, “O Abu Mas’ud, know that Allah is more able than you on this slave” Ibn Mas’ud said, ” I will never beat any slave again ‘f In another narration, (the whip fell down from my hand because of the fear of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) in another, “I said, he is free for the sake of Allah, the man said, if you did not do it, the fire would scorch you.” (Muslim)\nImam Muslim also reported that from the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said, “The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n“Whoever beats his slave for something which he did not do, or slaps him, its expiation is to free him.” (Muslim)\nHakim fun Hizam (may Allah be pleased with him) said that, “The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n“Allah will torture those who torture people in this worldly life” (Muslim)\nIn another narration, it is also reported,\n“Whoever unjustly beats anyone with a whip, it will be retaliated on him on the Day of Judgment.” (Previously mentioned)\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) was asked,\n“How many times should we forgive the servant? He replied, “Seventy times a day.” (Tirmidhi)\nOnce the Prophet (pbuh) was holding a Siwak (tooth-stick) in his hands and he called his servant, but he was late for some minutes. The Prophet said,\n“If there was no retaliation, I would beat you with this Siwak.” (Ibn Hajar)\nAbu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) had a black slave girl and he raised a whip on her but he said, “If there was no retaliation, I would beat you until you fell unconscious but I will sell you to the One Who will pay your price in full from me and he freed her for the sake of Allah.\nOnce, a woman came to the Prophet (pbuh) and said,\n“O Messenger of Allah, I said to my slave girl, ‘O adulteress! He said, ‘Is she truly as you say?’ She said, ‘No’ He said, ‘She would seek justice from you on the Day of Judgment.’ Thereupon, she returned to her slave girl and gave her a whip and said to her ‘beat me.’ The slave girl refused to do so. She freed her and returned to the Prophet (pbuh) and told him about that. He said, ‘May what you did be an expiation for your accusing her of such a thing.” (Hakim in his Mustadrak)\nIn the two Sahihs, the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n“Whoever charged his slave with an accusation while he is innocent from it, he will be flogged on the Day of Judgment as retaliation unless he was as he said.” (Bukhari)\nIn another narration,\n“The slave should be fed and clothed and should not be burdened with something beyond his capacity.” (Muslim)\nIn his death-disease, the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) used to advise his Companions saying,\n“Be heedful of prayer and of those whom your right hands possess. Feed them from what you feed yourselves and clothe them from what you clothe yourselves. Do not burden them with something beyond their capacity. In case you burden them, you should help them to fulfill it. Do not torment the creatures of Allah, for Allah made you the owners.” (Previously mentioned)\nOnce, a group of people entered upon Salman Al-Farisi (may Allah be pleased with him) while he was the governor of Al-Mada’in and they found him soaking a paste for his family. They said to him, would you not leave the slave girl to do this? He (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “We sent her for some concerns (affairs) and we hated to burden her with another thing.”\nAn early Muslim said, “Do not beat the slave for every fault, but count them for him. And in case he disobeyed Allah, beat him for this and remind him with his faults.\nIt is heinous maltreatment to the slave, both male and female to separate him from his children or his brothers. The Prophet (pbuh) is reported to have said,\n“Whoever separates a slave and his/her children, Allah will separate him and his beloved ones on the Day of Judgment.” (Tirmidhi)\nAli Ibn Abi Talib (may Allah honor his face) said,\n“The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) granted me two slave brothers. I sold one of them and thereupon the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “Bring him back again and repeated it.” (Tirmidhi)\nIt is also a heinous maltreatment to both the slave, male and female and to beasts to leave them until they get angry. The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) is reported to have said,\n“It is a sufficient sin for a person to prevent those whom he owns his food.” (Muslim)\nIt is mistreatment to a beast if it is: treated in a harsh manner, imprisoned, deprived of its food, or to burden it with that which is beyond its capacity. Concerning this Allah says,\n{There is not an animal (that lives) on the earth, nor a being that flies on its wings, but (forms part of) communities like you} (Al-An’am: 38)\nIt is reported that,\n“These communities will be brought on the Day of Judgment while the people will be brought on the Day of Judgment. While the people are standing, there will be judgment amongst the animals to such an extent that the bald-headed sheep will retaliate from the horny and the atom from another. Then it will be said to them, ‘Be dust.’ At this moment the disbeliever will say, “Woe unto me! Would that I were (mere) dust!” (Muslim)\nThis is evidence that there will be Judgment between the animals and the human being to such an extent that if a person unjustly beat an animal, or made it thirsty, prevented it food, or burdened it with that which is beyond its capacity, it will retaliate against him on the Day of Judgment in an equal way. To support this, we have the following evidence from the two Sahihs: Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n“A woman was tortured for a cat she imprisoned until it died. She went to Hell because of it, having neither fed it nor watered it, for she confined it and would not let it go to forage on the small creatures of the earth.” (Bukhari)\nIn Sahih Al-Bukhari, it is reported that,\n“The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) saw (in his dream) a woman hanged in the Hell and a cat scratching her face and breast and torturing her as she tortured it in worldly life by imprisoning it and preventing it the food.” (Bukhari)\nThis is applied to all kinds of animals. By the same token, the one who burdens the animals with that which beyond their capacity, they will retaliate against him on the Day of Judgment. In Sahih Al Bukhari, it is reported that, “The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n“Once there was a man driving a cow, he mounted it and beat it. Consequently, it said, “We have not been created for this, but for ploughing.” (Bukhari)\nThis is a cow and Allah caused it to speak to defend itself against oppression or to be used for something contrary to that for which it was created. Therefore, whoever unjustly burdens an animal with something beyond its ability, it will retaliate from him on the Day of Judgment in an equal way.\nAbu Sulaiman Al-Darani said, “Once I mounted a donkey and I beat it twice or thrice. Consequently it raised its head and said, “O Abu Sulaiman, there will be a retaliation on the Day of Judgment. So, belittle or do it more, as you like! Abu Sulaiman said, I will never beat anything again.\nOnce’ Abdullah Ibn ‘Umar passed by a group of boys from Quraish who used a bird as a target and shot at him. They made every false shoot for its owner. Upon seeing Ibn ‘Umar, they ran away. Ibn ‘Umar said, who did that? May Allah curse the one who did that? “The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) cursed the one who takes anything possessing life as a target.” (Bukhari)\nIn another narration,\n“The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) forbade that animals be imprisoned for killing.” (Bukhari)\nEven with what the Shari’ah allowed us to kill from animals, such as scorpions, snakes, mice and vicious dogs, “We are ordered to take their lives at once and should not torture them. The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n“If killing is to be done, do it in the best manner, and when you slaughter, do it in the best manner by first sharpening the knife and putting the animal at ease.” (Muslim)\nLikewise, the animals should not be burned by fire. In an authenticated hadith, the Messenger of Allah, (pbuh) is reported to have said,\n“Previously I ordered you to burn so and so with fire. Since there is no one who could torture with fire except Allah, if you found them, kill them (and do not burn them).” (Bukhari)\nIbn Mas’ud said,\n“Once we went out with the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) on a journey. He was engaged in fulfilling some of his needs. We saw a sparrow with its two children. We took its children and thereupon, it started to shout. The Prophet (pbuh) came and said, “Who made this sparrow grieve for its children? Return it’s (children back to it). Likewise, the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) asked us about a colony of ant’s which we burnt. And he said, “Who burned this colony?’ We replied, “It was us.” The Prophet (pbuh) said, “No one should torture anything with fire except its Lord.” (Abu Dawud)\nThis is evidence that it is not allowed to kill or torture with fire even a lice, fleas or otherwise. It is also forbidden to kill any animal merely for sport. The Prophet (pbuh) said,\n“If someone kills a sparrow for sport, the sparrow will cry out on the Day of Judgment, O Lord! Ask this person why he killed me in vain and did not kill me for any useful purpose.” (Nasa’i)\nIt is also detested to hunt birds during the period when they hatch their eggs or slaughtering an animal before its mother. Ibrahim Ibn Adham (may Allah bestow mercy upon him) reported,\n“Once a man slaughtered a calf before its mother. Thereupon Allah caused his hand to become paralyzed.”\nIt is also highly recommended to free a slave, whether male or female. Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “The Prophet (pbuh) said,\n“Whoever frees a believing slave girl, Allah will, with every organ of hers, free his organs from the Hell- Fire, even her private parts will be an expiation for his.” (Bukhari)\nAbu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported the Prophet (pbuh) saying,\n“Any Muslim frees a believing, male slave, he will be a salvation for him from the Hell-Fire. Every organ of his will be expiation for his organs. Any Muslim who frees two believing slave girls, they will be a salvation for him from the Hell-Fire. Every organ of theirs will be expiation for his organs. And any Muslim woman who frees a believing slave girl, she will be a salvation for her from the Hell-Fire. Every organ of hers will be an expiation for her organs.” (Abu Dawud)"

The Muslim neighbor, he has the right of a neighbor and the right of Islam. And the disbelieving neighbor, he has the right of a neighbor.” (Suyuti)\nIbn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) had a Jewish neighbor. Whenever he slaughtered sheep, he used to say, “Carry some of it for our Jewish neighbor.” (Bukhari)\nIt is reported that,\n“On the Day of Judgment, the poor neighbor will hang himself on to the rich neighbor saying, ‘O Lord! Ask him why he deprived me of his charity and closed his door before me.” (Bukhari)\nThe neighbor should endure the evil conduct of his neighbor for it is a good treatment to him. A man came to the Prophet (pbuh) and said,\n“O Messenger of Allah, teach me a deed which if I do it, I will enter Paradise. The Prophet said, “Deal with good conduct”. He asked, “How O Messenger of Allah? The Prophet said, ‘Ask your neighbors, if they say that you deal with good conduct, then you are as they said, and if they say that you deal in bad conduct, then you are as they said.” (Hakim)\nThe Prophet (pbuh) is reported to have said,\n“Whoever shuts his door before his neighbor because of fear of him or his family and property, he is not a believer. And the one whose neighbor is not safe from his evil conduct is not also a believer.” (Al-Jami’ Al-Kabir)\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) also said,\n“For a person, to commit fornication with ten women is lesser than to commit it with the wife of his neighbor and to steal from ten houses is lesser than to steal from the house of his neighbor.” (Bukhari)\nIn Sunan Abu Dawud, Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that, “Once a man came to the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) complaining about his neighbor to him. The Prophet said,\n“Go and be patient. He came again twice or thrice. Then the Prophet said, “Go and place your belongings on the road.” The man went and did that. The people passed by him asking him about his affairs. He told them about his neighbor. The people cursed his neighbor saying, “May Allah cause him such and such and supplicated on him. Thereupon his neighbor came to him and said, “O my brother, come back to your house and you will never see anything you hate again.” (Abu Dawud)\nA person should endure the harms and hurts of his neighbor even if he was a Dhimi (non-Muslim living in Muslim country).\nSahl Ibn `Abdullah At- Tustri (may Allah have mercy upon him) reported that, “He had a Dhimi neighbor and from his water closet, there was a hole flowing into the house of Sahl. Sahl used to put a vessel under this flowing hole until all rubbish gathered in it and threw it during the night to conceal himself from the people. Sahl continued to do that for a long period until the time of his death come. He sent for his magian neighbor and summoned him saying, “Enter this house and look into it. He entered and saw the hole with rubbish flowing from it into the vessel and he said, what is this, which I see? Sahl said, this is from a long period, I receive it during the day and threw it during the night. The time of my death has come, and I fear that the manners of other people might not endure you, otherwise I would not tell you. So do what do you see. The magian said, O an old man, you treat me in such a way from a long period and I am still indulging in my disbelief? Stretch your hand to me, I testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Then the soul of Sahl was taken."

He replied, there is no good in her, she will go to Hell.”( previously mentioned)\nIn another narration, it is reported that,\n“Mention the good deeds of your dead and keep away from their bad deeds.”( Hakim in Al-Mustadrak)\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n“When I was taken up in the ascent (Mi’raj), I passed by people with fingernails of copper who were scratching their faces and chests with them. I asked who are they, Gabriel? And he said, “They are those who slandered others (ate people’s flesh) and attacked their reputations.”( Abu Dawud)\nIntimidation against instigation amongst the believers, animals and all kinds of beasts: the Prophet (pbuh) is reported to have said,\n“Satan has despaired of ever being worshipped in the land of the Arabs, but he is still hoping to instigate them against each other.”( Baihaqi in Shu’ab Al-Iman)\nTherefore, whoever instigates the sons of Adam against each other and spreads amongst them what causes them harm, he is a tale bearer and he is among the people of the Satan who are the worst of creatures.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) is reported to have said,\n“Will I tell you about the worst amongst you? The companions replied, ‘Yes, Messenger of Allah.’ He said,”\nThe worst amongst you are the talebearers, who instigate the friends against each other and who seek hardship for the innocent.”( Bukhari in Al-Adab Al-Mufrad)\nIn an authenticated hadith, the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) is reported to have said,\n“The talebearer will never enter Paradise.”( previously mentioned)\nThe talebearer is the one who transfers speech among people or between two friends in a way that harms them or makes their hearts alienated towards each other. He said, such and such said about you so and so and did so and so, unless it will be of a benefit or in his interests such as warning him against an evil which may happen or is expected.\nAs for instigating animals, beasts or birds against each other, it is not allowed such as bickering among cocks, bullfights among rams and instigating dogs against each other.\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) prohibited such actions and whoever does it, he disobeys Allah and his Messenger. Making the heart of the wife alienated towards her husband, or a servant towards his master, also comes under such evil doing. The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) is reported to have said,\n“Whoever instigates the wife against her husband or a slave against his master is a cursed person.” We seek refuge in Allah from such doing.”( Abu Dawud)\nInvitation to make reconciliation amongst people Allah, the Almighty said,\n{In most of their secret talks there is no good: but if one exhorts to a deed of charity or goodness or reconciliation between people (secrecy is permissible): to him who does this, seeking the good pleasure of Allah, we shall soon give a reward of the highest (value)} (An-Nisa’: 114)\nConcerning this verse, Mujahid said, “This is general between all people. Allah means that there is no good in secret talks of the people except in acts of goodness and this is what meant by Allah’s saying, “But if one exhorts to a deed of charity… ” Ibn ‘Abbas said, what is meant is that maintaining relations with one’s kinship and observing Allah’s worship. All charitable acts are called good because they are realized by the mind. “Or a conciliation between people.” This is encouraged by the Messenger of Allah. He (pbuh) said to Abu Ayub Al-Ansari,” Would I lead you to a charity which is better for you than the red camels.’ He said, ‘Yes, Messenger of Allah.’ The Prophet said,\n“Reconcile between people when they are quarreling with each other and bring them near each other when their relationship breaks down (by ceasing relations) with each other.”( Haithami in Majma’ Al-Zawa’id)\nUmm Habibah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) to have said,\n“All the speech of Adam’s sons are counted against them except enjoining good, forbidding evil, or remembering Allah, the Almighty.”( Tirmidhi)\nIt is also reported that a man said to Sufyan, what a harsh speech this is! Sufyan said, “Didn’t you hear to Allah’s saying {In most of their secret talks there is no goods but if one exhorts to a deed of charity or goodness} This is typically applied to such speech. (Bukhari)\nThereafter Allah, the Almighty indicated that these acts will avail only the one who seeks the Pleasure of Allah and He said, “We shall soon give him a reward of the highest (value)” i.e. an endless reward.\nIn the hadith, it is reported that,\n“The liar is not the one who reconciles between people, encouraging good or saying something good.”( Bukhari)\nUmm Kulthum said, “I heard the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) permitting something of what the people say, except in three cases, war, reconciling between people and talks between the man and his wife and vice versa.\nSahl Ibn Sa’d Al-Sa’idi (may Allah be pleased with him) said that,\n“The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) was told that there is an enmity between the people of Banu ‘Amr Ibn ‘Awf.

The Prophet said, “O Abu Bakr if you anger them, you anger your Lord”. Abu Bakr (pbuh) went to them and asked, “O my brothers! Did I anger you? They replied, “No, may Allah forgive you our brother?” (Muslim)\nAllah, the Almighty said,\n{And keep yourself content with those who call on their Lord, morning and evening, seeking his face.} (Al-Kahf: 28)\nThis verse was revealed concerning preference of the poor. Its cause of revelation goes as follows:\nthe first to believe in Allah’s Prophet (pbuh) were the poor. This is true with respect of every sent Prophet. The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) used to set with the poor amongst his companions such as, Salman, Suhayb, Bilal and `Ammar Ibn Yasir (may Allah be pleased with them all). Consequently the polytheists wanted to trap him by driving out the poor for they heard that the first sign of the true Prophet is that he would be followed by the poor. Some polytheists came to the Prophet and said, “O Muhammad, drive the poor out for we disdain to sit with them. If you drive them out, the masters and notable of people will believe in you. Consequently, Allah, the Almighty revealed,\n{Send not away those who call on their Lord, morning and evening, seeking His face.} (Al-An’am: 52)\nWhen the polytheist despaired of Muhammad driving the poor out they said, “O Muhammad, if you will not drive them out, separate between us by making a day for them and another for us. Consequently, Allah the Almighty revealed,\n{And keep yourself Content with those who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking His face, and let not thine eyes pass beyond them, seeking the pomp and glitter of this life.} (Al-Kahf: 28)\nThis means that you should keep yourself amongst such kind of people and should not turn your eyes to worldly gain, or worldly attractions.\n{Say, the truth is from your Lord.” Let him who will, believe, and let him who will, reject (it).} (Al-Kahf: 29)\nThen Allah strikes the similitude of the rich and the poor saying,\n{Set forth to them the parable of the two men.} (Al-Khaf: 32)\n{Set forth to them the similitude of the life of this world.} (Al-Kahf: 45)\nWhen the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) migrated to Medina, the poor migrated with him and they lived in the courtyard of the Mosque of the Prophet. They, in turn were called the people of Sufa (courtyard).\nAny poor who migrated from Mecca, would join them in Medina until they were of a huge number (may Allah be pleased with them all)."

The Prophet (pbuh) said,\n“Wearing gold and silk has been made unlawful for the men of my community but permissible for its women.” (Tirmidhi)\nOn the authority of Huzaifa Ibn Al- Yaman (may Allah be pleased with him) who said,\n“The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) made it unlawful for us to drink or eat in the vessel of gold or silver, to wear or set on silk.” (Bukhari)\nTherefore, he who makes wearing silk by men permissible, he is a disbeliever. The Prophet (pbuh) made it lawful only for the one who suffers from a certain disease such as scabies and for the soldiers in time of fighting. As for wearing silk for only ornament by men, it is unanimously prohibited. Whether it is a hat or a turban. Likewise, if the most of the cloth is silk, it is also unlawful. Wearing gold by men is also unlawful, whether it is a ring or a sheath of sword. It is unlawful to wear or make it. Once, the Prophet (pbuh) saw a man wearing a ring of gold, took it off from his hand and said,\n“It is an easier act for anyone of you to handle afire brand than to do such thing.”(Muslim)\nLikewise, the embroidery of gold on embellished turban is also unlawful. As for boys wearing gold and silver, the scholars are in disagreement. Some of them consider it permissible and some others consider it unlawful for the generality of the following saying of the Prophet (pbuh),\n“These two (gold and silk) are unlawful for men of my Ummah, but lawful for its women.”( Abu Dawud)\nThus, boys are included in this prohibition.

Allah, the Almighty has said,\n{Eat not of what the name of Allah has not been mentioned over.} (Al-An’am: 121)\nConcerning this verse, Ibn ‘ Abbas said, “What is meant is that the dead animals and that which killed by strangling. All these types are included in the verse of Al-Ma’idah (5:3). Al-Kalbi said, what is meant is that over which the name of Allah was not mentioned and that which is slaughtered to other than Allah’s name. `Ata’ said, “Allah prohibited animals which were slaughtered by the people of Quraish for their idols.\nAllah’s saying, {Verily it is disobedience} means that all things which are slaughtered and over which the name of Allah was not mentioned are dead and it is disobedience. {But the Satan ever inspire their friends to contend with you.} The Satan whispers to his friend to argue falsely with the believer concerning the dead animals Ibn ‘Abbas said, the Satan inspired to his friend from human beings saying, how do you worship a thing which you do not eat what he kills, yet you eat what you kill? Consequently, Allah, the Almighty revealed, {If ye were to obey them} i.e. making the dead a lawful thing, {Ye would indeed be pagans.} Al-Zajaj said, this is evidence that he who made what Allah has prohibited lawful or vice versa, is a polytheist.\nIt may be asked, how the slaughterings of the Muslim are lawful although he forgot to mention Allah’s name and the verse stated the contrary? The answer will be: The interpretations stated that what is meant by “On which Allah’s name hath not been mentioned, is the dead animals and not the slaughterings on which the Muslim has forgotten to mention the name of Allah. There are many things that indicated that the verse is concerned with the dead, such as {verily it is an obedience.} Therefore, the one who eats from the slaughtering of the Muslim on which he has forgotten to mention the name of Allah is not a profligate?\nLikewise, {But the Satan ever inspire their friends to contend with you.}. By the consensus of the interpretations, the contention was concerning the dead animals and not of the Muslim. By the same token, {If ye were to obey them, ye would indeed be pagans.}\nAbu Mansour told that, on the authority of Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him). Who said, “A man asked the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) what do you say concerning a man who slaughters but forgets to mention Allah’s name?

        "description": "Allah, the Almighty has said,\n{There is the type of man whose speech about this worldly life may dazzle thee and he calls Allah to witness about what is in his heart, yet he is the most contentious of enemies. When he turns his back, his aim everywhere is to spread mischief through the earth and destroy crops and progeny but Allah loveth not mischief} (Al-Baqarah: 204-205)\nImam Al-Ghazali (may Allah have mercy on him) said, “Picking apart another’s words consists of attacking another’s speech by revealing the mistakes in it, involving no other motive than contempt for the other and displaying one’s cleverness. He also said, disputation is what relates to clarifying various legal positions and making a case for them.\nConcerning arguing, he also said, “Arguing is importunateness in speech to gain one’s end, whether monetary or other. It may be initiated by oneself or in response to another.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, “Disputation may be true or false.”\nAllah, the almighty said,\n{And dispute ye not with the People of the Book, except in the best way.} (Al-’ Ankabut: 46)\nHe, the Almighty also said,\n{And dispute with them in the best way.} (An-Nahl: 125)\nHe, Most High, also said,\n{None can dispute about the signs of Allah but the unbelievers.} (Ghafir: 4)\nTherefore, when the intention behind disputation is to reveal the truth, then it is recommended. But if it is intended to confront the truth or unknowingly done, then it is unlawful. According to this detail, the texts concerning its permissibility or prohibition were revealed. A certain person remarked, “I have not seen anything that impairs one’s religion, diminishes one’s respectability, ends one’s happiness or preoccupies one’s heart like arguing.” (Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya concerning the matter of silence.)\nIf one objects that a person must argue to obtain his rights, the reply is that as Al-Ghazali (may Allah have mercy on him).” The stern condemnation of it applies to those who argue without right or knowledge, such as the deputy of the judge who proceeds in dealing with disputation before knowing justice and on which side it is so he disputes without knowledge.\nOf stern condemnation is the one who demands his right. That is because such a person does not only demand his right, but displays picking apart others’ words, lying, harming and assaulting towards his opponent. Or someone who adds abuse to his speech that is necessary to secure his rights, or is motivated to argue by nothing besides an obstinate desire to win and to finish his opponent.\nAs for someone who has been wronged and makes his case in away compatible with the Sacred Law, without belligerence, excessiveness, or importunateness, and not intending mere obstinacy and abuse, it is not unlawful, though it is better to avoid it if there is no way to do so, for keeping one’s tongue within the limits of fair play during the course of an argument is virtually impossible, Moreover, arguing produces rancor in hearts and causes animosity that can lead to actual hatred between two people, until each comes to be pleased when harm befalls the other and to be displeased at the good, and unleashes his tongue against the other’s reputation. Whoever argues runs the risk of these calamities. At minimum, a quarrel comes to preoccupy one’s heart so that during the prayer one’s thoughts turn to debating and arguing, and one does not remain, as one should, Disputation is the source of evil as well as arguing and picking a part one’s words, Therefore, one should not open the door for disputation unless for a necessity.\nOn the authority of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with both of them) who said. The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n“It is enough sinful to be an arguing person.”( Timidhi)\nAli (may Allah be pleased with him) is reported to have said, “Disputation invokes disasters (upon the person).\nOn the authority of Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said, “The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n“He who presses for something without knowledge remains under the hatred of Allah until he gives it up.” (Al-Asbahani in At-Targhib wa At-Tarhib.)\nOn the authority of Abu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said, “The Prophet (pbuh) said,\n“No people went astray after having been guided save that they were afflicted with arguing” then he recited, {They did not mention him (Jesus) to you as an example except for argument.} (Al-Zukhruf: 58) (Timidhi)\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,\n“The things I fear most for my Ummah is a case of “a scholar’s slip the arguing hypocrite over the Qur’an and the worldly life which cuts your necks off, so accuse it within your hearts.” (Ibn Hajar in Majma’ Az-Zawa’id)\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n“Arguing over the Qur’an is unbelief.”( Abu Dawud)"

Do not they think that they will be raised upon a Mighty Day, a day when (all) mankind will stand before the Lord of the worlds?} (Al-Mutaffifeen: 1-6)\nAs-Saddiy said the reason of revelation of the above Ayah traces back to Prophet’s arrival at Medina where he found a man called Abu Juhainah who had two scales, one for giving and the other for receiving.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n“Five entail five. They asked, what do you mean, Messenger of Allah? He said, “ whenever a group of people break a covenant, Allah will entice their enemy to attack them. Whenever, they rule by other than Allah’s revelation they will be plagued by poverty. If indecency prevails, they will be afflicted by many deaths. If they cheat when weighing Allah will withhold their pasture-lands (or pasturage) and they will face barren years. If they do not pay Zakat, Allah will deprive them of rain.”\nMalik Ibn Dinar said, once one of my neighbors came to me suffering from a deadly disease saying! “Two mountains of fire, two mountains of fire”. “What do you say”, I asked. He said, Abu Yahya, I had two scales, one for giving and the other for receiving. Malik Ibn Dinar, said, I, therefore, crush them with one another. Thereby the man said, the more you crush them, the more suffering I get, Abu Yahya. Afterwards, the man died affected by illness.\nCheating when weighing or measuring out goods is considered as a type of theft, a breach of faith and consuming other’s property through falsehood. Allah promises to punish such people with wail which may be interpreted as a severe torture or a valley in Hell-Fire. This valley is so hot that it can melt all the mountains of the world.\nOne of the early Muslims said, I testify that all those who weigh or measure will enter the Hell-fire.\nThis is because; none can measure justly save those whom Allah protects. Another one said, once I visited a sick man suffering from the death trials. Thereby, I began to instruct him to say the testification of faith, but he could not speak. When he became conscious, I asked him, why did not you repeat the testification of faith? He answered, O brother, the scale’s blade was upon my tongue and prevented me to speak.\nThereupon, I asked him, did you give short weight? He said, never. But, I used not to wait for a while after weighing to check. Behold! This is the abode of those who do not check their scales. How about those who give short weight.\nNafi’ narrated that Ibn ‘Umar who when passing by a seller used to say, “’fear Allah and give just measure or weight.” This is because the cheaters when weighing or measuring will be bridled by sweat up to half of their ears on the Day of Judgment.\nSome of the early Muslims said, woe to those who give short weight to others even a seed less in return for Paradise. Whose width is that of the whole of the heavens and the earth? Woe to those who take over weight from others even a seed over (if the buyer is the one who weights)"

One day, he ascended the minaret to call to prayer as usual. The minaret was juxtaposed to a house belonging to a Christian man. When he cast a glance into the house he saw a very beautiful woman. He was so fascinated that he neglected the call to prayer and went to her. The woman asked him, what do you want? He said, nothing but you.\nShe said, “I could not do any indecency.” He said, “What about marriage?” She replied, “But you are a Muslim and my father will reject you.” He said, “I’ll convert to Christianity.” In doing so, I’ll marry you, she replied. Accordingly, be converted to Christianity to marry her. No sooner did he marry her than he fell down from the floor, where he was supposed to do something and died. Alas, neither did he remain a believer nor did he enjoy the woman.\nSalim Ibn Abdullah related that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) would frequently swear by saying,\n“No, by the changer of the hearts.”( Muslim, Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah and Ahmad)\nThis means that Allah changes one’s heart faster than the wind but in different way! Agreement, disagreement, willingness and hatred etc.\nAllah says,\n{And know that Allah cometh in between a man and his heart, and that it is He to whom ye shall (all) be gathered} (Al-Anfal: 24)\nMujahid comments that Allah comes in between one’s mind and his own hand as stated in Allah’s saying,\n{Verily in this is a message for any that has a heart and understanding or who gives ear and is a witness.} (Qaf: 37)\ni.e. he who has mind.\n`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) related that the Prophet (pbuh) would always say,\n“O Changer of hearts!

Ibn `Abbas answered, if he dies adhering to that, he will enter the Hell fire. ”\nOnce, a blind man came to the Prophet (pbuh) and submitted,\n“O Messenger of Allah, I have nobody to lead me to mosque, do I have a dispension to pray at home? Then the Prophet permitted him. But when he was going back the Prophet called him and asked, do you hear the call to prayer? The man replied, yes. “Therefore respond to it.” the Prophet said.”\nThe same hadith is reported by Abu Dawud as follows: Ibn Umm Maktum came to the Prophet (pbuh) and said,\n“O Messenger of Allah, there are large number of reptiles and beasts in Medina and I am blind, do I have a dispension to pray at home? Then the Prophet (pbuh) said, do you hear the words of the call to prayer (haiyaala salah, haiyaala salah). He said, yes.” The Prophet said, then you have to respond to. Another narration states that,\n“O Messenger of Allah, I am a blind man and live far away from the mosque and love an inconvenient guide, do I have dispension? “Whoever hears the call to prayer and no excuse withholds him to respond will not have his prayer accepted. They asked, 0 Messenger of Allah, what is an excuse? He said, fear or sickness. ”\n“May Allah curse three people: he who leads a group of people who hate him, a woman who spends a night angry with her husband, and a man who hears the call to prayer and does not answer. ”\nAbu Hurairah said, it is better for one’s ears to be filled with molten lead than to hear the call to prayer and not answer it.”\nAli Ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “The prayers performed by a neighbor of a mosque are not accepted except in the mosque.” Someone asked, who is a neighbor of a mosque? He replied, he who hears the call to prayer.” Ali also said, whoever hears the call to prayer and does not respond his prayer will not go further than his head except if he has an excuse.”\nIbn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him said, whoever likes to meet Allah as a Muslim should keep on performing the five prayers when the call to them is issued. This is because, Allah has given your Prophet the traditions of guidance (Sunna) and they (the five prayers) belong to such traditions. If you pray at home as does the one who remisses the prayer, then you neglect the Prophet’s Sunna. If you neglect the Prophet’s Sunna you will be astray. Verily, none of us would miss the congregational prayer but a wellknown hypocrite or a sick man. I remember that a man would be brought leaning on two men and put in the raw to attain its reward and escape the sins of missing it.”\nPerforming prayers in congregation is so great as mentioned in Qur’an Allah most high says,\n{Before this We wrote in the psalms, after the message given to Moses): “My servants the righteous, shall inherit the earth.} (Al-Anbiya’: 105)\nThe exegetes said that the righteous servants are those who perform the five prayers in congregation. In explaining Allah’s statement,\n{And we record that which they leave behind.} (Yasin: 12)\nThe exegetes said, “What they leave behind” means then steps.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n“Whoever purifies himself (makes his ablution) at home and then goes to one of the houses of Allah (mosque) to discharge his duty to Allah (to offer obligatory prayers) his one step towards a mosque wipes out a sin and another step rises his status”. If he continues sitting on prayer -carpet, after prayer is over, and he remains with ablutions, the angels beseech Allah for his blessings upon him and pray. /’ Allah! Forgive him! Allah have mercy on him.” (Muslim)\n“May I tell you something thereby, Allah will remit your sins, and thereby your position will be raised. The companions said, “Do tell us ‘O Messenger of Allah! He said, “Performing the ablution properly, going to the mosque frequently for prayers even in difficult and distressing circumstances and waiting for the next prayer after one is over. This is your Jihad in the cause of Allah.” (Muslim)"

Allah the Almighty says,\n{Thus is it ordained by Allah, and Allah is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing. Those are limits set by Allah: those who obey Allah and his Messenger will be admitted to gardens with rivers flowing beneath, to abide therein (forever) and that will be the supreme achievement. But those who disobey Allah and his Messenger and transgress his limits will be admitted to a fire, to abide therein: and they shall have a humiliating punishment.}\n(An-Nisa': 12-14)\nThe reward and the punishment mentioned in the aforementioned Ayat concerns those who deal with the inheritance. Abu Hurairah related that Prophet (pbuh) said,\n\"A man or a woman work abiding by Allah's commandments for sixty years until the death comes to them.\nThen they bring loss to the bequest and thereby they enter the hellfire\". Then Abu Hurairah reads, Allah's saying: {After payment of legacies and debts: so that no loss is caused (to any one)}\" Reported by Abu Dawud and At- Tirmidhi.\n\"Whoever prevents his heirs from receiving their inheritance, Allah will prevent his inheriting Paradise.” Reported by Ibn Majah.\n\"Allah has given every one his right.

This story ismantioned in the Sahih of AI-Bukhari.\nIf someone's spying entails undermining Islam and its people, or the killing of captives, enslavement, or plundering of the Muslims, or anything of the like, then he is one of those who strive for corruption in the land, destroying tillage and offspring, and he is subject to death, and deserves the torment (of Hell- Fire), may Allah save us from it, Anyone who spies necessarily knows that if ordinary talebearing is a major sin, spy's carrying information is far more abominable and heinous, May Allah save us from that for\nHe is the Ever-Clement?"

        "description": "The Prophet (pbuh) said,\n“Allah most high says: he who is hostile to a friend (Waliyy) of Mine, I declare war against”\n“Do not revile my companions, for by Him in Whose Hand is my soul, were one of you to spend gold equal to mount Uhud, you would not attain the reward of the handful of one of them or even half of it.” (Bukhari and Muslim)\n(Because what they spent benefited Islam more)\n“Allah! Allah! (Keep the thought of Allah) concerning my companions. “Do not take them as a target” (for your obscenity or charges) after me, He who loves them, loves me but he who hate them, hates Me, and he who offends them, offends me and in turn offends Allah and he who offends Allah, Allah almost takes him” (Tirmidhi)\n“The sign of faith is love of the helpers (Ansar), and the sign of hypocrisy is hatred of the helpers.” (Bukhari and Muslim)\nThis is because they were the first believers who fought the enemies of Islam fiercely at the lifetime of the Prophet (pbuh). Likewise, the love of Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) is of faith and the hatred of him is hypocrisy”\nThe excellence of the Prophet’s companions can be recognized by studying their biography and their traces during the Prophet’s lifetime and thereafter. This excellence is represented in their sincere faith, fighting against the disbelievers, disseminating the belief, declaring the Islamic rites, raising high the word of Allah and His Messenger and teaching others the obligatory and Sunna worshiping. Were not they, we would not receive anything concerning the religion. Hence, whoever disparages them is beyond the pale of Islam.\nSuch disparaging is undoubtedly out of the belief that they were wicked people and thus denying the sayings of Allah and His Messenger when praising them and indicating their virtues. They are also the intermediaries between the source and the target of sacred knowledge. Doubting the intermediary necessarily affects the source.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) said,\n“Allah has selected me and picked out my companions. From among my Companions, I have ministers, helpers, and relatives by marriage. Thereby, whoever disparages them entails the curse of Allah, His angels and all the people. Allah will not accept their deeds on the Day of Judgment.”( Ibn Hajar Al-Haithami in Majma’ Al-Zawa’id)\nAnas Ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) related, once the Prophetic Companions said,\n“The curse of Allah the angels and the whole people is upon whoever reviles my companions.” (Ibn Hajar Al-Haithami in Majma’ Al-Zawa’id)\n“Allah has selected me and picked out my companions. He also granted me friends, brothers and relatives by marriage. There will be another generation thereafter who will revile and disparage them. Therefore, you should not interact with them in food, drink marriage, prayer over them or prayer with them.” (Aqily in Durr As-Sahabah)\nIbn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) related that the Prophet (pbuh) said,\n“Hold your tongue whenever you hear the mentioning of my Companions, stars and destiny.” (Tabarani in Jami’ Al-Adhkar)\nScholars argued that, holding one’s tongue is a sign of complete submission to Allah.\nIt is obligatory for a Muslim to love Allah and his Messenger. Of the Prophet’s love is to love all what He was sent with, those who take after him, those who apply his tradition and guidance, household, companions, wives, progeny, servants, and to love whoever loves them and hate whoever hates them.\nAbu Ayyub As-Sakhtiyyani (may Allah be pleased with him) said, whoever loves Abu Bakr raises the minaret of the religion higher, whoever loves ‘Umar clarifies the way, whoever loves ‘Uthman, is enlightened by Allah’s light, whoever loves Ali adheres to the clearest principle and whoever says, the Prophet’s companions are good and right is free from hypocrisy.\nAs for the virtues of the Prophetic companions, they are countless. The best of the companions are the ten whom the Prophet promised to enter paradise. The best four of them are Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthman and’ Ali (may Allah be pleased with them all). Whoever doubts them, is a hypocrite.\nIn the hadith narrated by Al-’Irbad Ibn Sariyyah, the Prophet said,\n“You must follow my deeds (Sunna) and that of the rightly guided caliphs. Hold it and stick fast to it. Avoid novelties (in religious matters), for every novelty is an innovation and every innovation is an error and every error is in hell.” (Abu Dawud)\nThe Rightly-Guided Caliphs are: Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthman and , Ali. The former was mentioned in the Qur’an several times.\n“Let not those among you who are endued with grace and amplitude of means resolve by oath against helping their kinsmen, those in want, and those who have left their homes in Allah’s cause” (An-Nur: 22)\n{ Being the second of the two, they two were in the care.} (At- Tawbah: 40)\n{And he who brings the truth and who confirms (and supports) it.} (Az-Zummar: 33)"
